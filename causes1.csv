 [**Hospital 3**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   69 yr old male with recent history of CABG presented with sternal debridement
  /  unstable stenotomy.
 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  s/p bilat. pectoralis flaps, sternal plating with new fluid collection
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent CABG, sternal debridement and repair, now with new fluid
 collection.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images through the chest
 after uneventful administration of 90 mL of Optiray IV contrast.  Standard and
 lung algorithm images as well as coronal reformats were obtained.  This study
 was compared with [**2131-5-13**].

 CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  Several mediastinal plates are seen; separation of
 the sternal halves is still seen, particularly in the inferior aspect.
 Additionally, a new large presternal fluid collection is present, greatest in
 the space between the topmost and secondmost plates.  In the superior and the
 inferior aspect of the sternotomy, it appears to communicate freely with the
 retrosternal space (series 2, image 40), though the amount of retrosternal
 fluid is markedly diminished since the [**2131-5-13**] study.  There is no
 significant stranding or gas within the fluid collection. The fluid collection
 is somewhat broad- based, measuring approximately 3.0 cm A-P, 13.0 cm
 transverse.

 Small lymph nodes are noted in the mediastinum, the largest measuring 6 mm in
 the precarinal region (2:21).  The pericardium is slightly thickened and
 irregular, which is compatible with history of recent pericardial
 intervention; the focus of pericardial calcification is unchanged.  The heart
 is otherwise normal in size, with extensive coronary vascular calcifications.

 Lungs are notable for mild centrilobular emphysema.  Additionally,
 interstitial reticular opacities, most pronounced in the lung periphery and at
 the bases, are slightly worse than the last examination.  A 4-mm lung nodule
 is seen in the right upper lobe (3:28).  Bilateral pleural effusions are again
 seen; the right is slightly larger than the previous, the left slightly
 smaller; both remains small.  There is associated compressive atelectasis.

 This study is not designed to examine the abdomen, however, multiple low-
 density lesions in the liver are similar to the previous study; several of
 these are too small to fully characterize; the largest is in the left lobe
 measuring 23 mm, with fluid attenuation characteristics.  A left kidney lesion
 measuring 10 mm represents a cyst.  The kidneys are incompletely imaged, but
 fullness of the right collecting system is again seen.  No mass lesions are
 identified in the imaged portion of the spleen or adrenals. There is a small
 layering radiopaque gallstone.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Aside from the sternal anatomy described above, no suspicious
 sclerotic or lytic lesions are identified.  Large lipoma of the left
 infraspinatus muscle is noted.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  New large presternal fluid collection, with apparent communication with
 the retrosternal space, but amount of retrosternal fluid is small and has
 decreased since prior CT. Findings could represent postoperative seroma, but
 infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. No
 discrete abscess identified.

 2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, small, right greater than left.

 3.  Worsening mild peripheral and basilar reticular and ground glass
 opacities. Given their short interval worsening, a drug reaction should be
 considered. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis would be less likely to have
 such a rapid progression.

 4.  Layering radiopaque gallstones.

 5.  A right kidney cyst and liver cyst, unchanged.  Other numerous liver
 lesions are too small to characterize, but similar in appearance to previous
 study.

 6.  Fullness of the right renal collecting system is incompletely imaged;
 clinical correlation and/or imaging correlation recommended.

 7.  4-mm right lung nodule, for which followup is recommended in one year to
 document stability.

Pertinent Results:
[**2131-5-13**] Chest CT Scan: Sternal dehiscence with an extensive
fluid collection extending along the entire length of the
sternum. While this measures simple fluid density, infection
cannot be excluded. Bilateral pleural effusions measuring simple
fluid density.
[**2131-5-17**] Echo: There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2131-5-18**] LE U/S: 1. RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY: Extensive thrombosis
of the right femoral vein along its entire length and no
significant internal flow. 2. LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY: No evidence
for DVT.
[**2131-5-18**] Echo: The right atrium is moderately dilated. A
mass/thrombus associated with a catheter/pacing wire is seen in
the right atrium and/or right ventricle. This mass disappeared
later in the exam. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small and
hyperdynamic. There is mild LVH. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. Right ventricular systolic function is
borderline normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch
and the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. All findings discussed
with surgeons at the time of the exam.
[**2131-5-24**] UE U/S: Persistent areas of intraluminal thrombus in the
left IJ, and within the superficial veins of the left and right
cephalic veins, and new thrombus in the superficial left basilic
vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] was admitted [**5-12**] with sternal instability and
[**Month/Day (1) 1834**] chest CT scan which confirmed sternal dehiscence. It
was also notable for an extensive fluid collection extending
along the entire length of the sternum. He was empirically
started on antibiotics and taken to the operating room on [**5-15**]
for sternal re-wiring. There was no evidence of sternal wound
infection. Postoperatively, he was maintained on antibiotics and
wound irrigation. On [**5-17**] in the early AM, he became acutely
hypotensive and increased his chest tube drainage. Transferred
to the CSRU, Swan placed, and transfused one unit. Emergent Echo
revealed a moderate sized pericardial effusion that appeared
circumferential. His chest was ultimately opened emergently in
the unit for washout, and returned to the OR for complete
washout and a hole in the vein graft was sutured closed. Please
see op reports for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the with open chest and plastic surgery was
consulted regarding sternal plating. The following day he was
brought back to the operating room for chest closure. Echo done
at that time revealed an acute Pulmonary Embolism/Thrombus in
the RA/RV. This mass/thrombus disappeared later on exam. He then
[**Month/Year (2) 1834**] sternal plating closure/bil. pectoralis flaps done by
plastic surgery. Following surgery he was again transferred back
to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Argatroban started for
presumed HIT (eventually came back negative) and Hematology
consulted. On [**5-21**] he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. Following extubation a
bedside swallow study was done, which he initially failed, but
repeated [**5-23**] with improvement. Also on [**5-23**] he was transferred
to the SDU for further care. Extremity U/S revealed thrombus in
his right femoral vein, left IJ, superficial veins of the left
and right cephalic veins, and in the superficial left basilic
vein. On [**5-24**] a PICC line was placed. Although operative wound
cultures were eventually negative, per ID, he will receive 4
weeks of vancomycin for high risk of sternal contamination. He
continued to improve and worked with physical therapy during his
post-op course for strength and mobility. On [**5-25**] he was
discharged to rehab facility with the appropriate follow-up
appointments. Of note, he will remain on Coumadin for DVT/PE for
minimum of 6 months.

 MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH CONTRAST, DATED [**2133-2-2**]

 HISTORY:  56-year-old man with newly-diagnosed low-grade brainstem glioma, for
 radiation therapy.

 FINDINGS:  The study is compared with recent limited contrast-enhanced MR
 examination (for ""WAND protocol""), dated [**2132-12-31**].  Better appreciated on the
 current examination, particularly the axial FLAIR sequence, is diffuse
 expansion of the entire pons by uniform FLAIR signal abnormality, with the
 enlargement of the dorsal pons exerting stable mass effect upon the ventral
 aspect of the fourth ventricle.  There has been no significant interval change
 in the size or configuration of the ventricular chain to indicate obstructive
 hydrocephalus, and there is no evidence of tonsillar or upward transtentorial
 herniation.  The extensive signal abnormality extends dorsally to involve the
 left more than right inferior, middle and, likely, superior cerebellar
 peduncles and much of the contiguous left more than right cerebellar
 hemispheres.  The process also involves the pontomedullary junction and the
 rostral portion of the medulla, as well as the midbrain.  As on the previous
 study, there is no appreciable enhancement following contrast administration.
 There is no evidence of hemorrhage or cystic necrosis.

 Noted are multifocal T2 hyperintensities in bihemispheric periventricular
 white matter, again without enhancement, nonspecific.  The largest such
 lesion, with an unusual ""flame"" shape measures 13 mm and lies adjacent to the
 frontal [**Doctor Last Name 218**] of the right lateral ventricle. Noted is a small right
 parasagittal frontal burr hole with thin rim of adjacent enhancement and
 mildly enhancing, very small-caliber tract traversing the right midbrain and
 terminating in the right paramedian pons, at the level of the middle
 cerebellar peduncle, presumably related to recent stereotactic biopsy, with
 only minute petechial hemorrhage at the biopsy site. There is no pathologic
 focus of parechymal, leptomeningeal or dural enhancement elsewhere.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Extensive infiltrating lesion occupying and expanding virtually the entire
 pons, extending through the cerebellar peduncles to involve the left more than
 right cerebellar hemispheres, caudally to involve the pontomedullary junction
 and rostrally to involve the midbrain.  This lesion corresponds to the known
 fibrillary astrocytoma. There is no evidence of hemorrhage or necrosis,
 correlating with the histopathologic WHO Grade II.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right-sided high frontal stereotactic biopsy, CT-guided target
point, definition and MRI-guided intraoperative imaging.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of colon
cancer, as well as testicular cancer, who presents with
progressive signs of dizziness, visual difficulties, unsteady
gait for approximately 12 months. He was worked up including an
MRI scan that showed a brainstem lesion. He was referred to the
brain tumor clinic for consideration of a biopsy.

The patient has been followed at the [**Hospital6 **] at [**Location 10050**]. He had been treated for a number of medical issues. He
was examined by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66170**] whose physical exam reportedly
showed bilateral facial numbness and swaying, and a MRI of the
head was preformed. This demonstrated expansion of the
brainstem without significant contrast enhancement. The patient
was thus considered to have a brainstem glioma and started on
Decadron. The patient now presents for a surgical opinion. In
the office, the patient complains about dizziness, blurred
vision, double vision, occasional headaches, and unsteady gait.
He feels better with medications. He takes at baseline 2 Tylenol
a day. Has a history of arthritis in the lower back, otherwise,
he reports that the numbness in his hands has disappeared since
starting the Decadron. The patient has tapered his Decadron to a
dose of 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient is otherwise feeling
himself stable. He was told that he had a left lazy eye at
baseline, but the patient is not quite sure about the symptoms.
He denies otherwise any extreme fatigue, weight loss or other
symptoms.

Pathology [**2132-12-31**]:
MIDDLE CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE/PONS STEREOTACTIC BRAIN BIOPSY
(including intraoperative smear):
DIFFUSELY INFILTRATING FIBRILLARY ASTROCYTOMA. WHO ([**2126**]) grade
II out of IV.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 M with PMH sigmoid and testicular ca in [**2125**], HTN, COPD,
admitted for new diagnosis pontine glioma s/p posterior fossa
decompression and necrotizing pna.
.
# Pontine glioma:
56 year-old man initially seen and discussed in brain tumor
clinic. Patient taken to OR on [**12-31**] for brainstem lesion biopsy
under general anesthesia. Postoperatively stayed in the PACU 6
hours then transferred to floor. On postop day one patient
demonstrated difficulty of swallowing which he failed his speech
and swallow evaluation. Patient kept NPO, started IV fluids. On
[**2133-1-2**] patient taken back to OR for a suboccipital chiari
decompression. Patient tranferred to neuro ICU for hemodymanic
and neurologic monitoring. Due to postoperaive respiratory
secretion extubated on [**2133-1-4**] after bronchcospy.
.
Brain stem biopsy pathology result is significant for
infiltrative astrocytoma. Radiation oncology decided not to
perform radiation mapping and to hold off for another several
weeks before planning to start XRT, since patient has a slow
growing glioma, and XRT could exacerbate pna.  Patient known by
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] will follow up with him as scheduled.  Patient was
transferred to Step-down unit on [**2132-1-7**].  His speech continued
to become more articulate and clear, and his mental status
continued to become more clear.  The patient stated that his
dizziness has improved.
.
# Necrotizing pneumonia:
Patient has a known pulmonary process that been followed in
[**Hospital 669**] [**Hospital **] hospital in MA. In house repeat CT of the chest
significant for left lower lobe, consolidative opacity, with
central area of necrosis, an air-fluid level, and
low-attenuation material. Additionally, there are several areas
within the right and left lungs peripherally, with patchy
opacity and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, concerning for multifocal
opacity. There is also a wedge-shaped opacity in the right lower
lung zone, some of which may represent atelectasis.There is a
3.3 x 2.6 cm nodule with multiple foci of calcification within
the left lower lobe. Attempt to obtain images from [**Hospital **] hospital
regarding pulmonary lesions for comparison, [**Name (NI) 653**] with
MEdical records to sent ua CD images. Medicine and
interventional pulmonary services recommended continue
antibiotics, and follow up with chest CT with and with out
contrast in 4 weeks in pulmonary clinic. In the mean time
[**Name (NI) 653**] with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] at the [**Hospital **] hospital regarding
tranfering him over to VA regarding his known pulmonary process,
and colon carcinoma for further work up which he was agreed with
the transfer.
.
Pleural fluid culture grew out positive to MSSA, GNR, [**Female First Name (un) 564**]
albicans, staph coag neg. BAL culture grew out Stenotrophomonas
maltophila and Klebsiella sensitive to almost all abx tested.
ID was consulted and created antibiotic regimen of clindamycin,
bactrim, ceftriaxone, to be continued for 4-6 weeks.  Levo was
completed for 2 weeks (last date [**2133-1-27**]).  Patient should be
reassessed to refine abx regimen within 2-4 weeks.  The patient
greatly improved on suctioning and chest PT, maintaining >95% RA
on the floor.
.
The following labs will need to be followed up after discharge:
LFTs, mycolytic/fungal cx, Cdiff x3, legionella urinary antigen
.
# Urinary retention:
Patient had no urine output after foley was d/ced.  Straight
cath released 980 ml of urine.  After 2 days of straight caths,
patient recovered normal urination, and does not have a foley
upon discharge.
.
# Skin lesions:
Dermatology consulted in reference to his left deltoid skin
lesion, non-bleeding which is present for 5 year according to
patient. Dermotalogy recommended excision of the lesion to rule
out melanoma once acute issues resolved with Derm Surgery
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2977**]).
.
# Anemia:
Patient's Hct was around 25 during admission.
.
# HTN:
Controlled.  Diltiazem and captopril were continued as per her
outpt regimen.
.
# Access: Picc placed [**2133-1-9**].

Medications on Admission:
The patient is a 56 y/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4746**] with a PMH significant for sigmoid
and testicular cancer in '[**25**], HTN, and COPD who was admitted to
the neurosurgery service on [**2132-12-31**] with a new diagnosis of a
pontine mass after 1yr of progressive dizziness and ataxia. He
underwent a stereotactic bx on [**12-31**] showing a low grade glioma
and received a palliative posterior fossa expansion on [**1-2**].
.
Routine pre-op CXR revealed multiple opacities and a 3x3 cm well
demarcated cavitary lesion with an air/fluid level in left
posterior lung. Following his surgery, he was extubated w/out
event but required reintubation later that evening [**1-22**]
desaturation.  On [**1-3**], a chest CT was done which showed a
multifocal pneumonic process with LLL necrotizing PNA. He
underwent a bronch on [**1-4**] with BAL revealing MSSA and
stenotrophamonas and was started on Levofloxacin (now d10/14),
Vanco (since d/c), and Clinda (d10/42) at this time. Bactrim
(d5/14) was added on [**1-8**] when BAL grew stenotrophamonas.
.
During this time, he has been intermittantly hypoxic with thick
secretions requiring frequent suctioning.  Over the past 2d, he
has been afebrile and his secretions have cleared appreciably.
He has maintained his O2 sats on 4L NC.  Other than this, the
patient has been intermittantly hypertensive requiring the
addition of captopril to his outpatient regimen.  He has also
failed numerous speech and swallow evaluations requring NG tube
feeds to maintain his nutritional status.  From an oncologic
standpoint, his pontine lesion is not amenable to resection and
the plan is to initiate palliative radiation therapy.  Per
neurosurgery, his prognosis is extremely poor.  Finally, the
patient has requested transfer to the [**Location 1268**] VA system
over the past several days as he has received much of his care
at this hospital.  Discussions are still ongoing to facilitate
this transfer.

 INDICATION:  64-year-old male with fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.

 PA and lateral chest radiograph compared to [**2200-1-6**], show slight
 improvement in right pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis.  There is
 continued cephalization of the pulmonary vessels, compatible with fluid
 overload.  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  A right PICC terminates in
 the SVC atrial junction.  The TIPS stent overlies the right upper quadrant.
 Again seen is focal symmetrical narrowing of the tracheal air column above the
 thoracic inlet, which is a nonspecific finding but may reflect post-intubation
 stenosis.

 IMPRESSION:  Compared to [**2200-1-6**], there is slight improvement in
 right pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis. Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.

Pertinent Results:
CXR: IMPRESSION: Study limited due to low inspiration. Bibasilar
likely
atelectasis although underlying aspiration or pneumonia cannot
be excluded. There may be a small left pleural effusion.

Head CT: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage seen. Appearance
of the brain is unchanged from [**2199-6-18**]. Opacification of
visualized right maxillary sinus unchanged.

Abdominal U/S: GRAYSCALE IMAGING: The liver demonstrates a
heterogeneous echotexture without focal mass lesion detected on
this limited evaluation of the hepatic parenchyma. No intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation with the common duct
measuring 3 mm. The gallbladder appears unremarkable, without
wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid/intraluminal stone.
There is splenomegaly with the spleen measuring 17.6 cm. No
intra-abdominal ascites. DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color and pulsed
pulse-wave Doppler images were obtained. The main portal vein is
patent with normal hepatopetal flow with a velocity of 22
cm/sec. The TIPS shunt is patent with wall-to-wall flow.
Velocities of 27, 90 and 94 cm/sec. The splenic vein and SMV are
patent. IVC demonstrates patency with triphasic waveforms.
IMPRESSION: Normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall flow. No
ascites identified.

L/SI Spine plain films and Pelvic plain films:





Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory failure:  The patient developed respiratory
failure during seziure activity and recent HCAP.  He was
intubated for airway protection and sent to the MICU.  He was
able to be extubated days later without difficulty.  The patient
was treated with lasix for diuresis.  Sputum cultures were
positive for klebsiella, proteus, sensitive to meropenem, zosyn
and tobra however most likely contaminent not infection, and the
patient was not started on antibiotics as the patient had
received vanc/ceftriaxone/flagyl eariler in his hospital course.
 He was evaluated by pulmonary who felt his tachypnea was likely
due to fluid overload. He was diuresed and his respiratory
status later stabilized. No further bronchoscopy was recommended
as it was unlikely that he laryngeal/tracheal stenosis given his
clinical improvement with diuresis.
.
#Seizure disorder:  The patient has a known seizure disorder and
hx of NCSE.  He again had continuous seizure activity documented
by continous EEG monitoring.  His home regimen of keppra,
zonegran and topamax was increased and ativan, dilantin were
added to the regimen. He required dilantin loading on two
occassions. His seizures were eventually well controlled and the
ativan was weaned off without seizure recurrence under EEG
monitoring. His mental status started to improve signficantly
and at discharge, he was answering questions briskly, able to
state the place but did not know the date, and was eager to
leave the hospital.
.
# Cirrhosis: Secondary to NASH.  During his hospital stay his
LFTs/bili and coags remained stable.  He underwent an abdominal
U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall flow.
No ascites identified.  He was continued on lactulose and
rifaxamin.
.
#. Stage IV sacral decub:  No evidence of osteomyelitis per
X-ray.  Wound care consulted and recommended daily packing.
.
#DM: The patient was temporarily taken off home lantus as had
episodes of hypoglycemia.  He was restarted on his home dose of
lantus without problem.
.
#Hypothyroidism: continued home levothyroxine
.
# Hypernatremia:  The patient became transiently hypernatremic
during his MICU course.  Free water boluses were increased
through his tube feeds.  The hypernatremia resolved.
.
# CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe
perfusion defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left
ventricular cavity size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved
systolic function.  No recent h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo
with improved EF.

Service:  MEDICINE [**Hospital1 **] FIRM

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old female
with a history of hypertension who was living at home by
herself and had been lethargic, fatigued and dehydrated the
past week because of a heat wave, fell down two days prior to
admission and had been down for approximately 36 hours when
she was then found by her son.  She was taken to [**Hospital3 42966**] where her sodium was 115, potassium 2.5 and a head
CT revealed an subacute subdural hematoma.  She was then
transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] on
[**2112-7-10**] for further care.  Upon arrival, she had dried blood
on her scalp and appeared slightly confused at times, but was
occasionally oriented x3.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension x10 years
2.  Heart murmur, the character and type of which was not
known.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once a day
2.  Tiazac 180 mg once a day
3.  Levobunolol eyedrops GGTS

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a sister with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol or tobacco history.  The patient
lives by herself, but in close proximity to both of her
children who check on her everyday.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION DURING ADMISSION:
GENERAL:  The patient was a well nourished, well dressed,
elderly woman in no acute distress, but slightly confused,
however.  Oriented x3.
HEAD AND NECK:  The left eye has a surgical pupil, but the
right is reactive.  Her cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.
NECK:  Supple.  She had no appreciable jugular venous
distention.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.
CARDIAC:  She had an irregular heart rhythm with a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur that radiated to the carotids.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nonfocal.
EXTREMITIES were 5/5 strength with 2 reflexes bilaterally.

LABS ON PRESENTATION:  She had a white blood cell count of
17.1, hematocrit of 30.4, platelet count of 265.  Sodium of
115, potassium 2.9, chloride 78, bicarbonate 23, BUN 24,
creatinine 1.0 and glucose 133.  The patient's cardiac panel
showed a troponin of less than 0.3, CPK of 666 and a CK/MB of
15.5.  A urinalysis was done which was yellow and cloudy with
protein greater than 300, large blood, trace ketones, small
bilirubin, pH of 5, specific gravity of greater than 1.030,
large leukocytes, negative nitrite and greater than 50 white
blood cells and red blood cells.  The patient's
electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with decreased
ST segments in V5 and V6.  The patient also had reports from
[**Hospital3 3765**] of a head CT of 1.2 cm x 6.5 cm of right
post frontal subdural without midline shift.  Chest x-ray
also by report from [**Hospital3 3765**] showed an obscured right
heart border and a cervical spine by report from [**Hospital3 42966**] showed no fracture or dislocation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit under medicine service with consultation
from neurologic surgery.  During her Medical Intensive Care
Unit course, the patient's repeat head CT showed subdural
hematoma which was unchanged to slightly smaller.  The
patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by enzymes,
despite the electrocardiogram changes persisting.  The
patient was felt to have hypovolemic hyponatremia and was
started on normal saline infusion with improvement of her
sodium from 115 to 120, as well as improvement of her mental
status.  The patient was never intubated.  She had an episode
of chest pain during her second Medical Intensive Care Unit
day, but the electrocardiogram was unchanged.  A second panel
of cardiac enzymes were sent which were again negative.

The patient was transferred from the Medical Intensive Care
Unit to the medicine floor on [**2112-7-11**].  The patient was
given intravenous Zantac as well as Protonix for likely
epigastric pain presenting as chest discomfort with no relief
of her chest pain.  The patient was then given 1 mg of
intravenous morphine which relieved her pain, but made her
very drowsy.  At this point, it was felt that the patient was
too drowsy in order to adequately monitor her neurologic
status and there was some question of whether or not there
was a depression in her neurologic status despite the
morphine.  She was then sent again for a repeat CT scan which
showed no change in her subdural hematoma and the patient
denied any further chest discomfort from then on.

The patient's neurologic status also remarkably improved by
[**2112-7-12**].  The patient was taken off of aspiration
precautions after a speech and swallow consultation.  The
patient was treated for her hyponatremia with fluid
restriction, thought likely to be SIADH given her subdural
hematoma.  Her sodium continued to increase through her
hospital course.  She was given some hypertonic sodium
chloride solution, 3% sodium chloride which also helped
increase her sodium level.  The patient was found to have
some congestive heart failure and was occasionally given
Lasix diuresis as needed.  The patient had an echocardiogram
which was completed on [**2112-7-11**] which shows severe
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild dilated left
atrium, hyperdynamic left ventricle with an ejection fraction
of greater than 75%, aortic valve leaflets severely thickened
and deformed, moderate aortic stenosis, mild mitral stenosis,
1+ to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery
hypertension.

The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation according
to telemetry and repeat electrocardiogram with slight
decrease in the level of ST depression from the baseline
electrocardiogram.  Cardiology was consulted in order to
determine how best to manage her atrial fibrillation, aortic
stenosis, but also given her contraindication to
anticoagulation given her intracranial bleed.  At that point,
cardiology's recommendations were to continue to rate control
her with Diltiazem 180 mg q day and not cardiovert her
secondary to the contraindications, as well as not give her
aspirin secondary to her bleed.

Neurosurgery continued to follow the patient until [**2112-7-13**].
Their recommendations were that the patient should follow up
in four week with a repeat head CT.  The patient was treated
for a urinary tract infection during the course of her stay
with Levaquin 250 mg every day with a total course of seven
days.  The repeat urine cultures showed no growth which
indicated that there was adequate coverage with the
antibiotic chosen.  The patient's electrolytes were monitored
on a daily basis and repleted as necessary, especially in
regards to her potassium phosphorus and magnesium.  The
patient was able to tolerate a full diet without any
difficulty and on [**2112-7-14**], her fluid restriction was
removed without any complications upon her sodium.

Physical therapy and occupational therapy were consulted
which recommended that the patient move on to an inpatient
rehabilitation facility in order to regain her strength.  The
patient was discharged on [**2112-7-16**] to an inpatient
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Stable.
GENERAL:  The patient was alert and oriented in no acute
distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Her right pupil was
reactive, the left surgical.  Extraocular muscles intact.
Oropharynx was clear.
NECK:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous
distention.
LUNGS:  Minimal bibasilar crackles at the base, otherwise are
clear to auscultation.  She continues to have an irregularly
irregular heart rate with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur that
radiates to the carotids.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema and distal pulses are palpable 2+.
NEUROLOGIC:  The patient has equal upper extremity and lower
extremity strength, as well as 2+ reflexes bilaterally.

DISCHARGE LABS:  Her white blood cell count is 11.8.
Hemoglobin is 12.6.  Hematocrit is 35.8.  Platelet count is
266.  Her sodium is 132, potassium 4.3, chloride 94,
bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.8, glucose 123.  Calcium
is 8.9, potassium 3.2, magnesium 1.9.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Diltiazem Extended Release 180 mg q day
2.  Levobunolol hydrochlorothiazide 0.5% solution, 1 drop on
the left eye twice a day
3.  Levofloxacin 250 mg po x1 more day to complete a total of
a seven day course.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  COPD and severe hemoptysis.  History of ground glass opacities on
 prior chest CT.

 TECHNIQUE: Helical chest CT images were performed without intravenous
 contrast.

 COMPARISONS: CT chest [**2130-5-23**].

 CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST:  In comparison to the prior study areas of ground glass
 opacification and linear stranding at the lung bases have nearly completely
 resolved.  An area of ground glass opacification which had been noted in the
 medial left upper lobe is also nearly completely resolved. Linear
 opacification in the lingula is probably atelectatic.  No other lung opacities
 are identified. Mild centrilobular emphysema has an upper lobe predominance.
 Minimal adherent material in the anterior trachea is consistent with retained
 secretions.  No obstructing endobronchial lesions are identified.

 There is diffuse calcification of the coronary vessels. The heart is normal in
 appearance. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  Shotty prominent but
 nonpathologically enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the mediastinum. There is
 no hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.

 In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there is mild to moderate
 intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, particularly in the left lobe.
 The superior gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys are normal in
 appearance. The pancreas is atrophic.

 No destructive osseous lesions are identified.

 IMPRESSION:

 1) Near complete resolution of previously identified ground glass opacities
 within the lungs. Findings probably related to resolving aspiration,
 pneumonia, or pulmonary hemorrhage.
 2) A previously identified area of esophageal thickening is probably related
 to hematoma and is no longer visualized.
 3) Mild to moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is of uncertain
 etiology. If clinically indicated, further evaluation by ultrasound or
 abdominal MR is suggested.

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and a remote history of minor hemoptysis who presented to the
[**Hospital1 69**] for further management
of massive hemoptysis from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.

For about one week prior to admission, he noted increased
upper respiratory secretions and a cough which was secondary
to seasonal allergies.

On [**5-21**], the day prior to admission, he coughed up some
gross red blood and went to the local hospital.  He was
intubated there for airway protection and had a flexible
bronchoscopy at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital which showed large clots
diffusely in the airways.

Overnight, on [**5-21**] at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital, his hematocrit
dropped from 40% to 30%, and on the following morning, he had a
repeat bronchoscopy.  At that time, the bronchoscopy revealed
blood throughout the airways, with a possible source
in the left upper lobe apical/posterior segment.  He was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for
further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Severe low back pain.
3.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm which is 4 cm in diameter.
4.  History of lacunar cerebellar infarction.
5.  History of hemoptysis one year ago - reported negative
evaluation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Combivent.
2.  OxyContin 80 mg p.o. twice per day.
3.  Percocet five tablets p.o. every day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  His social history includes one pack of
cigarettes per day for over 30 years.  No known alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination, temperature was 100.5, heart rate was 82, blood
pressure was 119/51, respiratory rate was 12, and oxygen
saturation was 100% on 50%.  The patient was ventilated on
assist-control.  He was sedated initially on paralytic agents
to prevent cough.  His lung sounds were coarse throughout,
particularly on the right, with inspiratory wheezes.  His
cardiovascular examination was significant for distant heart
sounds.  A regular rate and rhythm.  A [**1-26**] holosystolic
murmur loudest at the apex.  Abdominal examination revealed
bowel sounds were present.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  Extremity examination revealed cool
extremities.  Pulses were 1+.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   His laboratory
data was notable for a hematocrit of 30.6 and platelets were
199.  Partial thromboplastin time was 27.  INR was 1.  His
electrolytes included a sodium which was 136, potassium was
3.8, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea
nitrogen was 12, creatinine was 0.6, and blood glucose was
92.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  The patient had a chest x-ray
that was unremarkable.  A chest CT showed a 1.5cm nodule in the
left upper lobe (? BAC).

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  The patient was had a flexible
bronchoscopy which revealed old blood diffusely, with a large
clot in the left mainstem.  There were no other endobronchial
lesions.  As to not disturb the clot, a rigid bronchoscopy was
schedueld.

On hospital day two, he had a rigid bronchoscopy that showed
dry blood in the left mainstem, which was removed.  The uptake to
the left lower lobe was erythematous and abnormal in appearance
and brushings, washings and transbronchial needle aspirates were
obtained.

Postoperatively, the patient was noted to be hypertensive, so
he was started on a nitroglycerin drip but otherwise had an
uneventful recovery.  The day after the rigid bronchoscopy
the patient was extubated and had adequate oxygenation for
the duration of his Intensive Care Unit course.

However, on the day following extubation the patient was
noted to have an opacity/infiltrate in the left lower lobe
that was consistent with a ventilator-acquired pneumonia.
Therefore, the patient was started on vancomycin and
ceftazidime.

The diagnosis of pneumonia was consistent with his low-grade
temperatures from 100 to 100.9 in the days following his
extubation.  The patient's oxygen requirements gradually
decreased over the course of his Intensive Care Unit
admission; weaning down to two liters by nasal cannula on the
day of transfer to the floor.

The pathology results from his bronchoscopy came back
negative for malignant cells.  These included two samples of
washings of the bronchial tree as well as a transbronchial
needle aspiration.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was noted throughout
the duration of his Intensive Care Unit stay to be
hypertensive with a blood pressure ranging from the 140s to
over 200 that coincided with his degree of pain medications.

It was noted after his rigid bronchoscopy for his blood
pressure to stay consistently over 200.  Due to concerns
about the effects on his cerebral vasculature, he was started
on a nitroglycerin drip which adequately reduced his blood
pressure into the 150s.  The nitroglycerin drip was turned
off the following day, and he was started on captopril for
afterload reduction, and this was maintained throughout the
remainder of his Intensive Care Unit course; initially
starting at 6.25 mg three times per day and titrating up to
25 mg three times per day.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was noted
following extubation to have a new left lower lobe infiltrate
that was consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia; as
noted above.  He was started on ceftazidime and vancomycin
for this infection which necessitated outpatient intravenous
therapy.

4.  PAIN ISSUES:  The patient came in with a history of
severe low back pain with a home regimen of 80 mg of
OxyContin twice per day with up to five Percocet tablets per
day.  He was initially started on a morphine drip for pain
that was titrated to his blood pressure and heart rate.
Following extubation, these requirements as he was able to
take oral intake.  His narcotic regimen was gradually
increased to his baseline regimen; including 80 mg of
OxyContin and five Percocet tablets.

5.  REHABILITATION ISSUES:  On the day following his
extubation, the patient was seen in consultation by Physical
Therapy who allowed him to walk around the Unit and increase
his capacity which had likely been reduced during his time on
the respirator.

6.  GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  The patient had a computed
tomography scan of his chest in the middle of his Intensive
Care Unit stay that was notable for a thickened esophagus.
This finding was not inconsistent with an esophageal
malignancy and should be followed up on as an outpatient, and
this was relayed to the floor team.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient to be discharged to the
Medicine Service at the [**Hospital1 69**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hemoptysis.
2.  Ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Severe low back pain.
5.  History of lacunar infarction.
6.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

The patient will follow-up with his referring pulmonologist for a
follow-up chest CT to evalute the nodule seen in the left upper
lobe (? BAC).

 INDICATION:  Patient with history of pancreatic tumor.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen and
 pelvis without and with IV contrast using a CTA protocol.

 CONTRAST:  150 cc Optiray IV due to fast bolus.

 COMPARISON:  CT [**2147-12-11**].

 ABDOMEN CT WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST FINDINGS:

 The lung base are clear. There is a biliary stent, as before.  There is no
 intrahepatic ductal dilatation.  No new liver lesions are identified.  The
 gallbladder is unremarkable. There is complex cystic mass in the head and neck
 of the pancreas, not significantly changed in size or morphology from the
 prior examination. The cystic component on Series 3A, Image 20 measures 21 x
 28 mm; it previously measured 21 x 26 mm. The septated cystic component at the
 neck of the pancreas measures 24 x 37 mm; it previously measured 24 x 36 mm.
 The proximal pancreatic duct is not dilated. There is a celiac axis lymph
 node, which measures 14 x 17 mm; it previously measured 13 x 16 mm.  Scattered
 peripancreatic lymph nodes are again identified, not significantly changed in
 size or number from the  prior study.  There are no focal fluid collections.
 The spleen and kidneys are stable in appearance.  Small bilateral adrenal
 adenomas are unchanged in appearance.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST FINDINGS:

 There is no free fluid.  There is vascular calcification. There are no
 pathologically enlarged peritoneal or retroperitoneal lymph nodes. There are
 no pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes. The bladder and
 distal ureters are unremarkable.

 Bone windows demonstrate mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine.  No
 suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.

 ABDOMINAL CTA FINDINGS:  Celiac axis and SMA are widely patent.  There is a
 clear distinct flat plane between the SMA and the pancreatic mass.  The
 splenic artery, common hepatic artery, gastroduodenal artery, proper hepatic
 and right and left hepatic artery are patent and unremarkable.  Portal venous
 phase imaging demonstrates flattening of the proximal SMV and portal
 confluence, as before.  The main portal vein and branches are patent.

 (Cont)

 There is mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation with a dilated common bile duct.

 Delayed CT exam demonstrates enhancement with apparent thickening of the
 descending duodenum.  Therefore, there may be involvement of the duodenum by
 tumor.

 CONCLUSION:  Since the prior exam, there has been no significant interval
 change in the appearance of the multicystic pancreatic lesion.  There is
 flattening of the proximal SMV, as well as the portal confluence, as before.
 The splenic vein and portal veins remain patent, as does the SMV.  There is a
 clear fat plane between the SMA and the lesion. Note is again made of celiac
 axis lymph nodes.

 MULTIPLANAR REFORMATIONS and volume rendered images confirm the above
 findings.

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease.

PROCEDURES DURING ADMISSION:  Three vessel coronary artery
bypass graft, left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending, saphenous vein graft to OM2, sequential on
[**2147-12-18**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59 year old
male with a past medical history significant for
hypertension, who was found to have a complex mass at the
head of his pancreas on workup for jaundice.  The patient was
seen by anesthesiology for preoperative evaluation of his
Whipple when an electrocardiogram was shown to have
nonspecific ST changes laterally.  The patient denied any
symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea.  The patient was referred for a
stress on [**2147-12-15**].  At peak exercise, he developed 3.[**Street Address(2) 38081**] depressions laterally and inferiorly with a
fall in his systolic blood pressure.  MIBI imaging
demonstrated moderate to severe inferior and apical ischemia,
global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 42%. The
patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory
for emergent catheterization.  The catheterization revealed
three vessel disease with an ejection fraction of
approximately 50%.  The left main seemed to be diffusely
diseased with 88 to 90% stenosis as was the left anterior
descending and left circumflex.  The patient was admitted and
underwent a preoperative workup and was taken to the
operating room on [**2147-12-18**], for a three vessel coronary
artery bypass graft.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 27294**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) **] on [**2147-12-8**] after a
motor vehicle crash in which he was ejected and pinned under the
car.  He was intubated at the scene.  He was seen by the trauma
surgery service and was consulted on by orthopaedics and plastic
surgery.

Injuries:1. Left open femur fx, 2. Right femur fx, 3. Avulsion
of left hand with extension tendon exposure. 4. Right pilon fx.

He was admitted to the trauma intensive care unit for further
monitoring.  On [**2147-12-9**] a traction pin was placed on his LLE
which resulted in return of DP/PT doppler pulses.  Later that
day he was consented and prepped for surgery, he was taken to
the operating room for a IM nail right femur, Closed reduction
right pilon fracture, Application multiplanar external fixator,
Operative treatment of left subtrochanteric femur, fracture with
intramedullary nail, Washout and debridement, left open femur
fracture wound, Treatment of left femoral shaft fracture with IM
implant.  He tolerated the procedure well and was taken back to
the trauma intensive care unit for recovery.  He was later
extubated without difficulty.  He remained hemodynamically
stable and was able to be transferred out of the trauma
intensive care unit to the floor on [**2147-12-10**].  He returned to the
operating room on [**2147-12-12**] for a washout and debridement of the
Left open femur fracture.  During that procedure an IVC filter
was placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of trauma surgery.  He tolerated the
procedure well without difficulty.  He was also transfused with
2 units of packed red [**Last Name (STitle) **] cells for post-operative anemia.  On
[**2147-12-15**] Mr. [**First Name (Titles) 27294**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] pressure was noted consistently high,
with his pain controlled and was started on 12.5mg daily of
lopressor, with noted effect.  On [**2147-12-22**] he was taken to the
operating room for removal of the right leg ex-fix with ORIF of
ther fibula and tibia.  He remained hemodynamically stable and
tolerated the procedure well.  He continued to work with
physical therapy to improve his strenght and mobility.
Throughout his stay his pain was controled and his vital signs
remained within normal limits.  He was discharged in stable
condition with instructions for follow up care.

 INDICATION:  Alcohol-related hepatitis cirrhosis.  Fever and diffuse abdominal
 pain.  Evaluate for cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, biliary tract dilation or
 focal liver lesion.

 COMPARISON:  [**2191-1-11**].

 RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND:  The liver is echogenic consistent with known
 cirrhosis.  No focal mass is visualized.  There is no intrahepatic biliary
 ductal dilatation.  The gallbladder wall is thickened with edema, as mentioned
 previously.  This is likely secondary to underlying liver disease.  There is a
 moderate amount of sludge in the gallbladder, new from the prior study.  The
 gallbladder is not distended however.  No gallstones are visualized.  The
 common duct is not dilated, measuring 2 mm.  The pancreatic head area is not
 well visualized.  There is a small amount of ascites fluid within the abdomen,
 with fluid seen surrounding the liver and small amounts in bilateral lower
 quadrants.  There is no suitable spot to mark on the skin for bedside
 paracentesis.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval development of gallbladder sludge.  There is a similar amount of
 gallbladder wall thickening and edema, likely related to underlying liver
 disease.  The gallbladder is not distended.
 2.  No intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.

IMAGING:
MRI HEAD:
FINDINGS: There is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute
infarct. There are no enhancing abnormalities. There is
increased T1 signal within the basal ganglia prior to the
administration of IV contrast. These findings are commonly seen
in patients with liver failure. There is no midline shift, mass
effect, or hydrocephalus. No areas of abnormal magnetic
susceptibility are noted. Normal vascular flow voids are
present.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of an enhancing abnormality or mass.

No acute infarct.

Increased T1 signal in the basal ganglia bilaterally consistent
with the patient's history of hepatic failure.
.
TEE:
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. The patient was sedated for the TEE.
Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information
section). The posterior pharynx was anesthetized with 2% viscous
lidocaine. No TEE related complications. 0.1 mg of IV
glycopyrrolate was given as an antisialogogue prior to TEE probe
insertion.
Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
IMPRESSION: No echo evidence of endocarditis.
.
RUQ Ultrasound:
IMPRESSION:
1. Successful ultrasound-guided diagnostic and therapeutic
paracentesis.
2. Hepatopetal flow of the main portal vein
.
RENAL ULTRASOUND:
The right kidney measures approximately 11.8 cm and the left
kidney measures approximately 11.5 cm. There is no evidence of
hydronephrosis or renal lithiasis bilaterally. Areas of ascites
are again demonstrated throughout the abdomen. No focal bladder
wall masses are identified in the prostate appears slightly
enlarged measuring approximately 5.1 x 4.3 x 4.3 cm.
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of hyrdronephrosis or renal lithiasis.
2. Mild prostatic hypertrophy.
3. Abdominal ascites
.
BONE SCAN
IMPRESSION:
1) No definite evidence of osteomyelitis.
2) Linear increased
lower sacral uptake consistent with a fracture.
3) Marked, diffuse bilateral increased renal uptake is
non-specific and may be secondary to interstitial nephritis


Brief Hospital Course:
38 y/o M w/ Alcohol/HepC cirrhosis with admitted with s. aureus
bacteremia, and seizure.
.
1) [**Name (NI) 11646**] unclear source.  Patient did not have localizing
signs or symptoms (other than chronic abdominal pain) and did
not have a history c/w meningitis/meningoencephalitis.  He
underwent TTE and TEE while in the ICU, both w/o evidence of
vegetation.  Surveillance cultures remained negative (although
all drawn on abx) and patient was w/o evidence of embolic or
immunologic phenomena on examination.  He remaineed afebrile in
house.  He also underwent bone scan to r/o occult osteomyelitis,
which did not show evidence of infectious focus.  LP was
deferred per neuro recommendations- it was felt that the patient
had been on antibiotics for approximately 5days on transfer from
OSH and his coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia would induce
additional risk for the procedure.  At the OSH, the patient was
initially started on vancomycin and CTX.  When sensitivities
returned as MSSA the patient was switched to nafcillin.  He
completed 12 days of antibiotic therapy and subsequently
developed ARF (Cr peaked at 3.5) but rapidly recovered.
FENA>1%, u/s neg, eos neg (including peripheral), sediment
bland.  Bone scan did show evidence of increased renal uptake
c/w intersitial nephritis.  He completed the last two days of a
total 14 day course with vancomycin.   He was afebrile on
discharge, w/ plan to obtain repeat blood cultures on Monday
[**1-24**].
.
2) [**Name (NI) **] unclear etiology. Patient w/o sz hx.  Interestingly,
the patient seized at the OSH on hospital d3.  This course was
concerning for etoh w/d but patient vehemently denies further
alcohol use.   He was initially loaded on dilantin and
subsequently maintained on keppra.   EEG did not show evidence
of sz focus.  Plan for patient to f/u w/ Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 951**] of Neurology.
.
3) Acute hepatitis- patient admitted to OSH with AST of approx
80, ALT approx 40.  These trended down following admission but
the patient subsequently developed a cholestatic appearance on
labs, with his bilirubin peaking at 15.7 and INR at 2.7.  Both
were trending down on discharge.  Again, the patient denied
alcohol use.
.
4) ARF- likely interstitial nephritis, as discussed above
.
5) ESLD- on discharge, plan to start re-start diuretics pending
evaluation of renal function on Monday.  Patient was continued
on lactulose in house.
.
6) Abdominal Pain - chronic abdominal pain in house.  Minimal
ascites but underwent ultrasound guided paracentesis that ruled
out SBP.

just blurry in the right eye, but with closing the right his
vision would improve.  He said this also partly effected the
way that he was walking and that his walking was better with
the right eye closed.

For the new reported visual changes, on physical examination,
showed a slight decrease in the later movement ability of the
right eye; consistent with a sixth nerve palsy.  The visual
fields were intact, however.

Given these new findings, a repeat head computed tomography
was ordered which showed no interval changes.  No effects of
the area in or around the orbit but still showing the
bilateral epidural hemorrhages and frontal edema.

Regarding the difficulties in smell and taste, over the
course of the weekend the patient did notice an improving
anosmia; which, per the behavioral neurologist, was
considered likely to improve over time.  For the anosmia,
which decreased the patient's appetite, they were
supplementing his diet with Boost drinks three times per day.

The patient had been on fluid restriction during her
hospitalization to reduce cerebral edema; as ordered by
Neurosurgery.  This restriction was safely discontinued prior
to his discharge to the rehabilitation facility.

The patient was re-evaluated for neurologic rehabilitation
centers after being rejected on the original day of discharge
and was approved by [**Hospital3 6841**] Clinic in [**Location (un) 5905**] for discharge to an inpatient setting on [**2132-8-20**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  No changes made to medications on
discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to the
[**Hospital3 6841**] Clinic.

was patent. The LAD had a 70% proximal and a 90% mid vessel
stenoses. The LCx was patent but there was an 80% stenosis in
the OM1. The RCA had mild nonflow limiting disease. 2. Resting
hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided filling
pressures with an RVEDP of 8 mm Hg and a mean PCWP of 10 mm Hg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.33 l/min/m2. 3. Left
ventriculography was deferred. 4. There was a severe aortic
stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 45.89 mm Hg and a
calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.62 cm2. 5. Peripheral angiography
demonstrated no right iliac disease. 6. Short run of SVT during
the case that terminated spontaneously.

[**2162-3-2**]. Cardiac cath revealed severe aortic stenosis along with
2 vessel coronary artery disease and a dilated ascending aorta.
He was then referred for surgical evaluation. [**Date Range **] all
pre-operative testing and was brought to the operating room on
[**2162-3-3**]. He [**Date Range 1834**] an Aortic Valve Replacement, Asc. Aorta
Replacement, and Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 2. Please see
operative report for surgical details. He did have significant
amount of post-op bleeding that required multiple blood
products. Following surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition.  Within 24 hours he was
weaned from sedation awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
On post-op day one there appeared to be left arm edema with
bluish discoloration and left-sided neck bulge. All left arm
peripheral IV's and arterial line were removed, vascular surgery
was consulted and an upper extremity ultrasound was performed.
Ultrasound was negative for DVT. His chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. Diuretics and
beta-blockers were initiated and he was gently diuresed towards
his pre-op weight. On post-op day two he was transferred to the
telemetry floor. He continued to improve post-operatively and
worked with PT for strength and mobility. Left arm swelling and
neck bulge has resolved.  Clinically he appeared to be doing
well but needed additional PT and was discharged to rehab
facility on post-op day seven.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 39-year-old gentleman,
who sustained a 30-foot fall, hitting a porch prior to
landing on the ground.  There was no loss of consciousness,
and the patient arrived in the Trauma Bay complaining of a
chest pain on arrival.  He was noted to have a massive
bleeding from his oropharynx and became hypotensive to the
60s.  He was emergently intubated, and a right femoral cordis
was placed.  His blood pressure improved with a fluid
resuscitation, and his chest x-ray was clear.  He had good
saturations after intubation.  A DPL was performed given his
hypotension as an unknown source that was positive after
instillation of 1 L of saline.  He was also noted to have a
left upper extremity open fracture.  He was taken emergently
to the operating room for exploration.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  None known.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial physical exam:  Heart rate was
88, blood pressure 82/palpations, and 02 saturation 90
percent.  The patient had an unstable face with a lip
laceration and blood in his oropharynx.  GCS of 15.  Pupils
equal, round, and reactive with TMs clear.  Heart:  Regular
rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Sternum stable with no crepitus.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Rectal was guaiac
negative with a normal prostate and normal tone.  Back showed
no step-offs or lacerations.  Pelvis was stable.  Left
forearm with an open fracture unstable with a 2 plus radial
pulse.  Right arm question dislocation, and left and right
lower extremities are without deformities.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8.1, hematocrit
38.9, and platelets 244,000.  Chemistry-7:  Sodium 143,
potassium 4, chloride 104, and bicarbonate 29.  PT was 12.2,
PTT 19.4, INR 1.0, fibrinogen 199, and lactate was 3.5.  ABG:
pH was 7.38, pCO2 43, pO2 232, bicarbonate 26, and base
deficit minus 2.  UA was moderate blood and urine tox
negative.  Initial films:  Chest x-ray negative and pelvis
negative.  Left forearm showed an ulnar fracture with radial
head displacement.  Left shoulder was negative.  Left wrist
was negative.  Right shoulder, a nondisplaced fracture of the
greater tuberosity.  A right humeral neck fracture that was
nondisplaced and impacted.  CT of the head:  Frontal
contusion, small temporal bleed, frontal sinus fracture of
the anterior and posterior table, and Le [**Location 56204**] fracture.
CT of the C-spine was negative.  CT of the chest showed
bilateral pneumothoraces, right greater than left, with a
right upper lobe collapse and a sternal fracture.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  As per HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 20598**] was taken
emergently to the operating room for exploration.  On
entering the abdomen, they found a laceration of the
transverse mesocolon, splenic decapsulation, liver
laceration, and multiple colonic deserosalizations.  The
splenic decapsulation was repaired, as were the serosal
injuries to the colon.  The transverse mesocolon was
repaired, as was the liver laceration.  The Orthopedic
Surgery team then came into the operating room for washout
and closed reduction of his left Monteggia fracture of the
radial head without long-arm splinting.  He remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure without
hypothermia.  Of note, prior to this, because of the known
intracranial hemorrhage with hemodynamic instability,
Neurosurgery was called for bolt placement.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] ICP
monitor was placed with pressures in the 10 to 13 range.  He
was also placed on IV Ancef perioperatively.  He was then
taken to the Trauma ICU where several consults were obtained,
including an Ophthalmology consult regarding his orbital wall
fractures.  They did not identify any entrapment on CT and
recommended outpatient followup.  He had subsequent bilateral
chest tubes placed and a subclavian line placed on return to
the ICU.  He was seen by Oromaxillofacial Surgery regarding
his facial fractures and was taken to the operating room on
[**2156-4-12**] for open reduction and internal fixation of his mid
face fractures.  Of note, he had a large laceration of his
eyebrow/nasal region that had been closed on the day of
admission.  Of note, because of his multiple facial injuries
and his deteriorating respiratory status over the course of
his ICU stay, he ended up developing Pseudomonas in his
urine.  A tracheostomy was performed on [**2156-4-7**].  He also
had an IVC filter placed on [**2156-4-12**] after bilateral lower
extremity ultrasound revealed a right common femoral vein
nonocclusive thrombus.  A CTA of the chest to evaluate for
pulmonary embolus was negative, but was a poor quality study.
He was subsequently additionally started on a heparin drip.
However, there was difficulty in making him therapeutic, and
a Hematology consult was obtained.  However, he was deemed to
have no identifiable hematologic problem and was eventually
maintained on goal PTT.  Coumadin was subsequently started.
He was maintained on antibiotics for the Pseudomonas in his
sputum.  He did continue to spike temperatures during his ICU
stay and required frequent suctioning and aggressive
pulmonary toilet to manage his copious secretions.  After
recovering from his last operation, which was the ORIF of his
facial fractures, he was finally transferred to the floor on
[**2156-4-20**].  Due to the fact that he was now a candidate for
anticoagulation, Vascular Surgery was re-consulted and his
IVC filter was removed.  He was then placed on Lovenox for
anticoagulation purposes.  He was able then to ambulate with
physical therapy.  However, he continued to have a very poor
p.o. intake.  We strongly encouraged p.o., and he stabilized
his intake and was cleared by Speech and Swallow and was
deemed stable for discharge to home from that standpoint.  He
was also placed on a Passy-Muir valve, which he tolerated
well.  He defervesced, and his antibiotics were stopped, and
he remained without any further infectious issues.  His
mental status improved, and he was able to follow commands,
and he was oriented x 3.  Once his mental status had
improved, his C-spine was clinically cleared and his C-collar
was removed.  He was followed up by Orthopedic Surgery, who
revised his cast after doing repeat films of his left upper
extremity.  He continued to progress well, and he was deemed
stable for discharge to home on postoperative day numbers 29
and 17, which was also hospital day number 30.

mg p.o. q.day, folate 1 mg p.o. q.day, Tylenol and magnesium.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's heart rate was 46, blood
pressure 158/51, SAO2 96 percent, respiratory rate 19.
Patient was awake, alert, slightly lethargic, oriented times
two.  Lungs were clear, left lung slightly coarse breath
sounds.  Abdomen soft, nontender.  Cardiac regular rate and
rhythm.  Extremities had no edema.  Neurologic exam showed an
awake, slightly lethargic, oriented times two, not to time,
slightly reversed when following commands.  Right eye had
slightly decreased adduction, slight decreased elevation of
the right eye.  Also left lateral gaze nystagmus.  Face was
symmetric.  Frontalis was intact.  Moderate dysarthria.  No
obvious drift.  Upper and lower extremities were full [**5-18**] for
muscle.  Reflexes were 1+ in the upper extremities and 1 in
the lower extremities.  No Hoffmann, no clonus.  Sensation
was intact to lower extremities bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.6, hematocrit 27.4,
platelets 309.  INR 1.3, PTT 33.2.  Sodium 139, potassium
3.4, chloride 106, CO2 22.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The plan for this patient was admission to
the ICU, obtain an MRI with gadolinium.  She was made NPO, IV
fluids at 80 an hour.  Neuro checks were q.one hour.  She was
given mannitol 25 q.four hours and Decadron 8 mg q.four
hours.  On [**8-13**] the patient was noted to be arousable,
oriented to person only, very dysarthric, more lethargic than
the previous day.  She had received Ativan at the time of
examination.  She did have a slight right drift.  She had an
MRI which showed a large right cerebellar T2 hypointense and
T1 hyperintense mass which measured about 5 cm in maximal
dimension.  A DWI scan [**Month (only) 3780**] loss of signal in the
right cerebellum and left frontal lobe.  MR [**First Name (Titles) 4058**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] flow in both intracranial carotid arteries and
in the anterior middle cerebral artery.  There was flow in
the vertebral arteries.  The impression was cerebellar and
cerebral hemorrhagic masses consistent with metastasis.  The
cerebellar mass is large and there is superior herniation
into the cerebellum and compression of the fourth ventricle.

Given the patient's exam and MRI findings, it was felt that
the patient should have an emergent craniotomy for removal of
this tumor and the hemorrhagic lesion.  Prior to surgery
patient did have an interventional pulmonology consult.  They
saw her and felt she had a left upper lobe mass infiltrate
with the diagnosis that included possible pneumonia versus
lung mass versus combination.  They did follow her throughout
her stay here and did not recommend that she needed
bronchoscopy at this time.  They referred her to oncology.

The patient was brought to the O.R. on [**2144-8-13**] where she
underwent craniotomy and removal of the right cerebellar
hemorrhagic lesion.  Patient did well intraoperatively and
had no complications.  On post-op day one patient was awake,
oriented times name only, inattentive, unable to follow
midline commands.  She had abduction depression of the right
eye.  Pupils were 5 to 3.5 in the right eye and left eye 4.5
to 2.5.  She had a question of bilateral slight pronator
drift, greater on the right than the left.  Recommendations
were to keep her blood pressure less than 150, use minimal
Ativan only and to slowly advance her diet.  Her post-op
hematocrit was 25.9.  Also on the 1st she had repeat MRI
which showed status post resection of right cerebellar
hemorrhagic lesion without residual enhancement.  Left
frontal hemorrhagic lesion with enhancement was suggestive of
metastatic disease.

The patient did require the use of Nipride to keep her
systolic blood pressure less than 140.  She did have periods
of agitation at times.  On [**8-15**] patient was awake,
continued in the ICU.  Her face was symmetric.  No rebound,
no drift.  Finger to nose showed slight right dysmetria.
Patient was advanced out of bed to a chair.  Her activity was
also increased.  Patient was continued on IV Decadron 4 mg
q.six hours.  In the late afternoon of the 2nd, patient was
transferred out of the unit awake, alert and oriented times
three, moving all extremities.  Vital signs were stable.  She
did see physical therapy when moved to the floor who
recommended that she receive visitations every day by them to
assist with her impaired mobility and help with her impaired
mental status.

On [**8-16**] the patient was awake, alert, oriented,
tolerating a diet, ambulating with help.  Her dysarthria was
noted to be improved.  She had a slight right drift noted.
Her dysmetria was also improved.  Her Foley was removed.
Decadron was continued to be weaned.  Occupational therapy
also saw her and assisted her with safety awareness and
helped her with her upper extremities.  On the 5th oncology
saw patient who felt that she most likely will receive
palliative chemotherapy with radiation rather than systemic
chemo.  Patient's special stains for melanoma were found to
be negative on [**8-19**].  Patient will need to go to a rehab
facility for further assistance with her gait and
rehabilitation needs.  She is to follow up in the brain tumor
clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].  She also needs to follow up with
hematology/oncology here at [**Hospital1 188**].

The patient was treated with Levaquin for pneumonia that was
diagnosed prior to admission.  She received 10 days of
Levaquin therapy.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  To keep the staples clean and dry,
do not get them wet.  She should have them removed on
[**2144-8-26**].  She can come back to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5 to have those removed
or she can have them removed at her rehab facility.  Right
now her appointment for the brain tumor clinic is pending.
Also her appointment with oncology is pending at this time.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:

Echocardiography [**12-1**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-1-25**],
LV systolic function is now more vigorous.

Chest x-ray [**11-30**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, slightly improved
from the

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory distress: Pt reported to the ED with a sudden
onset of shortness of breath. In the ED, he was initially
desatting to the 80s on a NRB, was put on Bipap, improved quite
rapidly and was eventually able to be weaned down to a NC and
was stable on 2L upon arrival in the MICU. His 02 sat was
continuously monitored. An echocardiography was done (EF>55%),
the results of which are above.
.
#Chest pain: Pt developed left sided chest pain, accompanied by
diaphoresis and mild dyspnea while moving around on [**2121-12-3**].
Pain resolved after about half an hour with sublingual
nitroglycerin and maalox and simethicone.  EKG at the time
showed new ST depressions and T wave inversion in I, aVL.
Troponins were cycled and were 0.16, 0.16, 0.15.  In the
morning, repeat EKG showed persistent T wave inversions, but
resolution of ST depression.  The overall picture was consistent
with an NSTEMI.  The patient underwent a nuclear stress test
which showed normal myocardial uptake and preserved EF of 59%.
He did not undergo catheterization as his stress test was
normal.
.
# Hyperkalemia - emergent hemodialysis at the bedside was
performed and the repeat K+ after dialysis was 3.3.
.
# ESRD - received emergent hemodialysis at the bedside and
resumed on his regular schedule.
.
# CAD - he was continued on his ASA, beta blocker, statin, and
plavix. He had a repeat echo, the results of which are above.
His cardiac enzymes were trended.
.
# Gout - continued allopurinol
.
# Hyperlipidemia - continued statin
.
# Hypertension - continue beta blocker
.
.

 MRI AND MRA HEAD

 HISTORY:  22-year-old woman with SLE, lupus nephritis causing end-stage renal
 disease on hemodialysis, left uveitis presents with hypertensive urgency,
 assess for intracranial hemorrhage or edema.

 MRI HEAD:

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1; axial T2, FLAIR, GRE, DWI, DTI of the head were
 obtained.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to CT of the head from [**2140-1-19**] as well as a
 head MRI from [**2138-4-17**].

 There are no intracranial hemorrhages or masses.  The [**Doctor Last Name 181**]/white matter
 differentiation is maintained with no areas of slow diffusion.  There are no
 signal abnormalities of the visualized [**Doctor Last Name 181**] or white matter.  Specifically,
 the changes seen on the MRI from [**2138-4-17**] consistent with posterior reversible
 encephalopathy are no longer visualized.

 Within the left globe, posterior to the lateral ciliary body and
 posterolateral to the left lens, there is a T2 intermediate signal lesion
 which measures approximately 5 mm in size.  The etiology of this lesion is
 uncertain, although it may relate to the known clinical history of left
 uveitis.  Direct visualization and correlation with clinical findings is
 recommended.

 The pituitary gland is diffusely T1 hyperintense although not enlarged.  This
 appears to be not significantly changed since [**2138-4-17**].  The CT scan from
 [**2140-1-19**] also shows that the pituitary is hyperdense.  These findings may
 represent pituitary hemorrhage.  Clinical correlation and correlation with
 endocrine function is recommended.

 There is apparent T1 hyperintensity of the basal ganglia bilaterally, which
 can be seen with hepatic dysfunction or hyperalimentation.
                                                             (Over)

 (Cont)

 Incidental note is made of Tornwaldt cyst within the midline of the
 nasopharynx.  There are also mucous retentions cysts of the maxillary sinuses
 bilaterally.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No intracranial hemorrhages or signal abnormalities concerning for
 posterior reversible encephalopathy.  Previously seen signal changes from
 [**2138**] have resolved.
 2.  5-mm lesion posterior and lateral to the lens in the left globe.  Clinical
 correlation and direct visualization is recommended.
 3.  T1 hyperintensity of the pituitary gland which also appears hyperdense on
 the CT scan from [**2140-1-19**].  This potentially may represent pituitary
 hemorrhage, although it appears stable compared to [**2138-4-17**].  Correlation with
 endocrine function is recommended.  If clinically indicated, this could be
 further evaluated by MR of the sella.

 COMMENT:  Above findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 67734**] [**Name (STitle) 2823**] on [**2140-1-24**].


 MRA HEAD:

 TECHNIQUE: 3D time of flight of the head was performed with MIP
 reconstructions.

 IMPRESSION:  The circle of [**Location (un) **], its major contributories, and its major
 branches are normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Patient is a 22 year old female with SLE, lupus nephritis,
ESRD on HD who presents with hypertensive urgency.
.
# Hypertensive urgency - Unclear precipitant.  Possibly
secondary to pain from worsening uveitis.  Compliant with meds.
Denies illicits and tox screen negative. Patient was started on
labetolol drip in ED with good BP response and was subsequently
transitioned to PO anti-hypertensives in ICU with maintenance of
stable SBPs in 150s-170s (baseline 170s-190s).  Per
nephrologist's recommendations, home lisinopril was increased to
40 mg po bid from 40 mg po qd for better baseline BP control.
No clinical evidence of end organ damage (UA difficult ro
interpret in setting of CRF).  CE's x 1 negative.
.
# Headache - No evidence by CT for intracranial bleed.
Headaches were well controlled with morphine sulfate and had
resolved by time of discharge.
.
# Uveitis - Followed by outpatient optho specialist.  Optho not
consulted per patient's request.
.
# ESRD - Secondary to lupus nephritis.  On transplant list.
Patient received hemodialysis in house with 500 ml ultrafiltrate
without complications.  At dry weight of 45 kg per patient.
Began Sevalamer 800 TID with meals.  Given difficulty in
interpreting renin and aldosterone levels in acutely ill
patients, these were not drawn and will need to be drawn at
outpatient follow up.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Worsening shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 48 year old
female with a history of metastatic breast cancer status post
lumpectomy and radiation with a history of two recent
admissions in [**Month (only) 116**] and [**2183-7-10**], for bilateral malignant
pleural effusions and bilateral pleurodesis requiring home O2
and Bi-PAP, now presenting with one week of progressive
worsening shortness of breath.  The patient noted, starting
approximately one week ago, progressively worsening shortness
of breath at rest with increasing home O2 requirements.  Two
days prior to admission, the patient presented to the
Emergency Department complaining of shortness of breath,
increased heart rate, decreased O2 saturations in the low
90s.  The patient was evaluated for pulmonary embolism by CT
angiogram which was negative with only slight increase in the
right pleural effusion and atelectatic changes.  The patient
was discharged home with home O2 to follow-up with her
Pulmonologist, Dr. [**Name (NI) **].

On the morning of admission, the patient saw Dr.
[**Name (NI) **], reporting worsening shortness of breath,
increased O2 requirements from 1.5 to 4 liters, decreased O2
saturations from the mid-90s to the low 90s and increased
heart rate above 100.  An echocardiogram of the lungs was
done showing no change in pleural effusions and the patient
was referred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for
transthoracic echocardiogram.

The echocardiogram revealed a moderate to large sized
pericardial effusion with a right atrial collapse and a right
ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired
filling and tamponade.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Metastatic breast cancer diagnosed in [**2177**]: Infiltrating
ductal carcinoma status post lumpectomy and radiation with
axillary node dissection, recurrence [**2182-8-10**];
admission [**4-/2183**] and [**7-/2183**] for bilateral pleural
effusions, bilateral pleurodesis requiring home O2.
2.  Cerebrovascular accident in [**2178**]:  Small hemorrhagic
cerebrovascular accident from a cavernous hemangioma.
3.  Seasonal allergies.
4.  Right low anterior rib fracture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   In brief, the patient is a 48 year old
female with a history of metastatic breast cancer status post
two recent admissions for bilateral malignant pleural
effusions, bilateral pleurodesis requiring home O2 and
bi-PAP, now presenting with progressively worsening shortness
of breath times one week and transthoracic echocardiogram
consistent with pericardial effusion.

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient with an echocardiogram
consistent with pericardial effusion.  The patient was taken
to the Catheterization Laboratory on [**8-21**], where the
effusion was tapped and drained for 250 cc. of serosanguinous
fluid.  Right ventricular pressure of 33/15, P- a pressure of
35/17, wedge of 21.  Cardiac output 5.3, cardiac index 3.2.

The drain was subsequently pulled on [**8-23**].  Miss [**Known lastname 16968**] had
an EKG upon admission which showed no evidence of electrical
alternans and EKG upon discharge which also showed no
evidence of electrical alternans.

The house officer was called to see the patient in the
evening of [**8-21**], for chest pain with inspiration.  A
pericardial rub was heard.  An EKG showed some elevation in
PR interval in AVR.

Throughout her hospital course, the patient remained
tachycardic, in the low 100s to 110.  A follow-up
echocardiogram was done revealing normal ejection fraction 45
to 50% and no evidence of pericardial effusion.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient has a history of malignant
pleural effusions likely contributing to her symptoms of
shortness of breath.  Dr. [**Name (NI) **] was made aware and
recommended no further intervention at this point.  The
patient was saturating well in the low 90s to 95 range on
four liters of nasal cannula which was decreased to two
liters prior to discharge.  The patient reported subjectively
that her shortness of breath had improved somewhat following
the tap.  She will return home on home O2 and Bi-PAP.

3.  Hematology/Oncology:  The patient has a history of
metastatic breast cancer and malignant bilateral pleural
effusions, now with a new pericardial effusion which is
exudative.  Cytology has been sent to evaluate if this is, in
fact, a malignant pericardial effusion.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was made
aware that the patient was hospitalized and involved in her
care during her inpatient stay.  She is scheduled to
follow-up with him on Tuesday, [**8-26**].  She will continue on
Xeloda and pain control with morphine, Percocet, Toradol and
Motrin p.r.n.

The patient was discharged home on [**8-24**], with the following
medications, discharge diagnoses and instructions.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  New pericardial effusion, cytology pending.
2.  Metastatic breast carcinoma with a history of malignant
pleural effusions.
3.  Cerebrovascular accident in [**2178**].
4.  Seasonal allergies.
5.  History of rib fracture.

MEDICATIONS UPON DISCHARGE:
1.  Xeloda 1650 mg twice a day.
2.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg p.o. q. day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  An appointment has been made for Miss [**Known lastname 16968**] to follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Hematology/Oncology on Tuesday, [**8-26**], at 02:30 p.m.
2.  It is recommended that the patient have a follow-up
echocardiogram to evaluate any further re-accumulation of
pericardial fluid.
3.  The patient is to call if she has worsening symptoms or
shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain.
4.  The patient is to resume all prior medications.  No new
medications have been added upon this admission.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, the patient had a chest x-ray
that showed no acute process, no suspicious nodules.  EKG on
[**2154-12-25**], sinus bradycardia, rate 49, inferior
lateral flat T-waves.  On [**2154-10-1**], CT of the thorax was
stable, no lesions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the transplant
service.  He was made NPO after midnight.  IV fluid was
started.  Lab work was sent off to use preop for the OR.
Labs preop:  White count 3.7, hematocrit 38, platelet count
38, fibrinogen 135.  Coags:  PT 17, PTT 37, INR 1.6.
Creatinine 1, BUN 19, sodium 139, potassium 3.9, chloride
105, CO2 26.  The UA was negative.

He was taken to the OR on [**1-18**] for orthotopic liver
transplant.  Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], co-surgeon was
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**].  EBL was 2 liters.  He was replaced with 5
liters of crystalloid, 6 units of FFP, 6 units of packed red
blood cells, 3 bags of platelets and 1 bag of cryoglobulin.
Please see operative report for details.  The patient was
intubated and taken to the surgical intensive care unit in
critical, but stable condition.

He was given induction immunosuppression of 500 mg of Solu-
Medrol, 1 gram of CellCept intraop.  In the SICU, his
hematocrits were followed closely.  He was replaced with IV
fluid.  Hematocrit was 30.6.  He was weaned and extubated.
His LFTs trended down.  Properatively, his AST was 1463, ALT
1116, alkaline phos 55, total bilirubin 3.9, and an amylase
of 279.  On postoperative day 2, his AST was 476, ALT 746,
alkaline phos 56, and a total bilirubin of 1.2.  A duplex
ultrasound of the liver demonstrated perihepatic ascites.
Portal veins and hepatic veins were visualized with normal
direction of flow, poorly dopplered hepatic artery waveforms
were noted, likely secondary to technical limitations.  A
repeat ultrasound was done on postoperative day 2.  This
demonstrated appropriate waveforms and directionality of flow
within the portal veins, hepatic veins, and hepatic arteries.
His LFTs continued to trend down.  Vital signs were stable.
His preop weight was 113.  On postoperative day 1, his weight
was 130.5.  He began on IV Lasix and his weight trended down
and achieved a weight of 116.7 no postoperative day 14.

His hematocrit trended down to 23.5 on postoperative day 9.
He received 3 units of packed red blood cells.  A repeat
hematocrit was 26.9.  He received another unit of packed red
blood cells as well as 1 unit of platelets for a platelet
count of 74.  Post-platelet transfusion was 114 and a post-
hematocrit was 32.1.  His hematocrit remained in the range of
28 to 29 for the remainder of his hospital course.  He did
undergo abdominal CT with and without contrast to evaluate
for any bleeding.  The CT demonstrated no cause for drop in
hematocrit.  There was moderate hepatic artery stenosis
noted.  There was narrowing of the portal vein at the area of
the anastomosis as well as mild stenosis at the origin of the
right renal artery.  A small amount of ascites and
perihepatic fluid was noted.  There were multiple low
attenuation areas in the transplanted liver likely
representing simple cysts.

When the patient was in the SICU, as he awakened, he
complained of pain control.  Patient was on Methadone 145 mg
p.o. q. d. at home and he had not been on this as of
postoperative day 2.  Dilaudid 2 mg IV q. 1 hour was
ineffective in relieving the patient's pain, so the Dilaudid
was increased to 4 mg IV q. 1 to 2 hours.  Methadone was
restarted.  The patient was started on clear liquids.  He
tolerated this without incident.  His blood sugars were
elevated and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained.  He was placed on
an insulin sliding scale to achieve normalization of blood
glucoses.  He was hypertensive while in the SICU.  He was
given Hydralazine and Lopressor.  Blood pressure improved and
ranged between 130s to 140s down to 90 to 100 systolic.
Lopressor was changed to p.o.  His Solu-Medrol was tapered
per protocol and he was started on 20 mg on postoperative day
7 of Prednisone and he remained on CellCept 1 gram b.i.d.
throughout this hospital course.  Prograf was started on
postoperative day 2 at 2 mg p.o. b.i.d.  Prograf was adjusted
and titrated to levels.  Prograf level increased to 18.9 on
postoperative day 8.  His dose was decreased and he was
stabilized on 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. with a Prograf level of 9 to
14 on 2 mg twice a day.

He was transferred to the medical/surgical unit where he
continued to recover slowly.  Pain control continued to be an
issue.  Consult was obtained.  Recommendations included
continuation of Methadone 145 mg q. a.m. and adjusting
Dilaudid p.o. to 8 to 16 mg p.o. q. 2 hours p.r.n.  For the
remainder of this hospital course, his pain continued to be
monitored.  He complained primarily of right upper quadrant
discomfort.  Towards the end of his hospital stay, his pain
was lessened and he was receiving 4 mg p.o. approximately 4
times a day.

A physical therapy consult was obtained.  PT worked with him
to ambulate.  Given his deconditioning, it was recommended
that he continue home PT.  He has 2 [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains; #1
was discontinued on postoperative day 5 and #2 JP drain
continued to drain approximately 290 cc of serosanguineous
fluid.  On postoperative day 7, he was started on IV
Vancomycin for some erythema around the incision at the left
lower quadrant.  This erythema resolved towards the end of
the hospital course and Vancomycin was stopped.  His white
blood cell count remained in the 4.7 to 6.6 range.  The
second JP was removed.  His LFTs continued to decrease.  He
was tolerating a regular diet and needed a lot of
encouragement to ambulate.

On postoperative day 9, patient complained of right neck
discomfort.  His right IJ site appeared mildly edematous.  A
carotid ultrasound was done.  This demonstrated no
pseudoaneurysm.  There was also noted of a right IJ partially
occlusive clot.  He was not started on Heparin or Coumadin.
The [**Last Name (un) **] consult was obtained.  He was maintained on a
sliding scale insulin regimen for moderately elevated blood
sugars.  He required a minimal amount of regular insulin and
this was tapered off towards the end of the hospital stay.

He was discharged home on postoperative day 15 in stable
condition.  His LFTs had trended down with an AST of 49, ALT
217, alkaline phos 102, total bilirubin 0.6, albumin of 3.1.
His creatinine was 1.1, BUN 21, white blood cell count 6.6
and a hematocrit of 29.4.  He was urinating independently
without any difficulty.  He was tolerating p.o. well.  Blood
pressure ranged between 118/72 to 135/78.  He was afebrile.
He was out of bed ambulating independently.  Visiting nurse
services were set up for medication management, AcuCheks and
wound assessment.  The plan was for him to return to the
[**Hospital 2514**] clinic on Monday, [**2155-2-3**], for assessment for
continuation of Methadone maintenance.  [**Hospital 2514**] clinic was
the Discovery House [**Hospital 2514**] Clinic.  That telephone number

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS/HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a
54 year old gentleman with a history of a [**2143**]5 feet with
no loss of consciousness, complained of headache on [**7-14**],
and went to [**Hospital **] Hospital.  Computerized tomography scan
of the head showed large right subdural hematoma,
longitudinally covering the whole hemisphere with about 2 cm
plus substantial midline shift and complete effacement of the
right lateral ventricle.  The patient was sedated and
intubated and sent to [**Hospital6 256**]
for further management.  On arrival the patient's pupils were
less than 2 mm and nonreactive.  The right was 5 mm and
nonreactive.  The patient was taken emergently to the
Operating Room for evacuation of acute subdural hematoma.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room and underwent
evacuation of a right frontal subdural hematoma without
intraoperative complications.  Postoperatively the patient
was intubated off of Propofol and attempted to open his eyes
to voice, moving all four extremities spontaneously.  After
attempts to localize the noxious stimuli, lower extremities
withdraw to pain.  His blood pressure was kept less than 120
with Nipride.  He continued on Propofol.  His pCO2 was kept
in the 30 to 35 range.  He had his thoracolumbosacral spine
cleared.  His cervical spine was unable to be cleared at that
time and he has remained in a hard collar.  On [**7-16**], he
had a repeat head computerized tomography scan which showed
post surgical changes and a small amount of  subdural
hematoma still visible.  His cervical spine showed
degenerative changes and spinal stenosis.  He was extubated
also on [**7-16**].  He was following commands.  He had right
drift in the upper extremity, but moving all his other
extremities spontaneously.  On [**7-18**], the patient had
another repeat head computerized tomography scan which showed
stable appearance of the remaining subdural hematoma.  The
patient was withdrawing all four extremities, less on the
right lower extremity, somewhat sleepy.  The patient was
transferred to the regular floor on [**2197-7-20**] and remained
in stable condition.  He had a swallow evaluation which he
passed, feeding tube was removed and he was able to start
taking p.o. intake.  He had flexion extension films done of
the cervical spine which were inadequate and needed to be
repeated.  Results of that are pending.  He has been followed
by physical therapy and occupational therapy and found to
require acute rehabilitation.  He is awake, alert and
following commands, moving all extremities.

Extremities, positive edema.  Pulses are palpable
bilaterally.  Skin is ecchymotic at intravenous sites.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data at the time of transfer
revealed white count 8.2, hematocrit 34.2, platelets 195,
sodium 138, potassium 4.5, chloride 101, carbon dioxide 32,
BUN 18, creatinine 1.3, glucose 118, CPK prior to admission
on [**462-12-13**], on [**413-12-14**], on [**394-12-17**]
and on [**394-12-19**].  Troponins are all less than .04
except for on [**12-13**], they were 0.05.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory, please see catheterization report
or full details.  In summary the catheterization report
showed normal left main with left anterior descending 80%
occlusion, circumflex 70% occlusion and right coronary artery
totally occluded.  Post cardiac catheterization,
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted.  In summary, the
patient was accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting at a
later date following a complete workup including carotid
dopplers, pulmonary function tests, and echocardiogram to
assess left ventricular function as well as his mitral
regurgitation and resolution of his right middle lobe
infiltrates as well as diuresis prior to his surgery.  The
patient was maintained on the Medical Service prior to his
surgery during his preoperative testing.  On [**12-20**], he
experienced an episode of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.  At that time he was seen by the
electrophysiology service who recommended that the patient be
loaded with amiodarone and started on heparin.  On [**12-23**] the patient complained of abdominal pain.  Following his
complaint of abdominal pain he had decreasing level of
consciousness followed by a cardiac arrest during which he
had periods of asystole, lasting six to eight seconds.
During that time he was pulseless.  He did rule in for a
non-Q wave myocardial infarction following his cardiac
arrest.  A temporary pacing wire was placed and he was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for continued
monitoring prior to his coronary artery bypass grafting.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was further complicated by an
episode of ventricular tachycardia during which the patient
was pulseless.  This occurred on [**12-26**].  The patient
was shocked out of the ventricular tachycardia with 300
joules followed by ventricular pacing with the temporary wire
he had in place.  The following morning, [**12-27**], the
patient was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent
an off-pump coronary artery bypass graft times one with a
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
please see the operation report for full details.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and he was transferred
from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit.  At the time of transfer, the patient's mean arterial
pressure was 70, central venous pressure was 12, he was
ventricularly paced at a rate of 70.  He had a propofol at 20
mcg/kg/min and Neosynephinre at 0.3 mcg/kg/min.  The patient
did well in the immediately postoperative period.  He
remained on his Neosynephrine infusion to keep his mean
arterial pressure greater than 70.  He remained intubated
throughout postoperative day #1 in anticipation of an
angioplasty to be done on postoperative day #1.

As stated, the patient was brought to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory on postoperative day #1.  At that
time his coronary arteries were again studied.  The
catheterization showed his left anterior descending to have
an 80% occlusion with competitive flow distally, circumflex
and obtuse marginal 1 to be 80% occluded and the right
coronary artery to be 100% occluded with proximal filling via
left to right collaterals.  His left internal mammary artery
to the left anterior descending was widely patent with normal
flow.  At that time he underwent an angioplasty of his obtuse
marginal 1 lesion.  The lesion was crossed and stented with
no residual lesion.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well, please see the catheterization report for full details.
Following the catheterization and stenting the patient was
transferred from the Catheterization Laboratory to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  Upon arrival the
patient's sedation was discontinued.  He was weaned from his
ventilator and ultimately extubated.  For the next 48 hours
the patient remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit, monitoring his hemodynamic stability and his
respiratory status.  On postoperative day #4 the patient was
transferred to Far 6 for continuing postoperative care and
cardiac rehabilitation.  Over the next several days the
patient remained on the Cardiothoracic Step Down Floor.  His
activity level was slowly increased with the aid of physical
therapy and the nursing staff.  He continued to be followed
by the Electrophysiology Service and on postoperative day #10
he was brought to the Electrophysiology Suite where he
underwent electrophysiology studies and automatic implanted
cardioverter defibrillator placement.  Please see
electrophysiology study report for full details.  The patient
remained on Cardiothoracic Step Down Floor for two additional
days at which time he was deemed stable and ready for
transfer to rehabilitation.

At the time of transfer to rehabilitation, the patient's
physical examination is as follows:  Vital signs temperature
97.7, heartrate 67, ventricularly paced, blood pressure
145/70, respiratory rate 18 and oxygen saturation 99% on 3
liters.  Weight preoperatively is 125 kg, at discharge is
121.8 kg.  Laboratory data on the day of discharge is white
count 9.5, hematocrit 28.7, platelets 273, PT 14, PTT 28.7,
INR 1.4.  Sodium 141, potassium 4.6, chloride 102, carbon
dioxide 31, BUN 24, creatinine 1.1, glucose 100.  On physical
examination he is alert and oriented times three, moves all
extremities and is conversant.  Respiratory, diffuse rhonchi
bilaterally, no rales.  Heartsounds, regular rate and rhythm.
Sternum is stable.  Incision with steri-strips, open to air,
clean and dry.  Abdomen is soft, nontender with normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm with 2 to 3+ edema and
palpable dorsalis pedis pulses.  The patient does complain of
pain in the right groin including the upper leg.  This pain
was noted preoperatively.  He had bilateral groin ultrasounds
which were negative for pseudoaneurysm.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thirty-seven year old female with recently diagnosed non-small cell
 lung carcinoma, now experiencing diffuse bony pain.  Referred for evaluation of
 bony mets.

 PHYSICAL EXAM:  Patient was tender to bony palpation in several areas including
 the knees bilaterally, the shoulders bilaterally, and the anterior rib cage
 bilaterally, right greater than left.  Patient also had slight back pain which
 could not be localized to a particular spinal element.

 DECISION:  In addition to whole body planar anterior and posterior views of the
 skeleton, additional SPECT images were obtained of the pelvis.

 INTERPRETATION:  Whole body images of the skeleton show focal intense tracer
 uptake in the metaphysis of the left tibia.  There is also focal uptake in the
 right anterior rib end of the 4th rib.  There is mild, symmetric uptake in the
 shoulders which most likely represents degenerative change.  The bladder has a
 slightly abnormal contour and appears asymmetric or displaced to the left.  This
 may be related to uterine fibroid; other pelvic pathology can not be excluded.

 The above described findings are consistent with bony metastases, especially in
 the area of the metaphysis of the left tibia.  The uptake in the right anterior
 rib end could be secondary to previous trauma, however in this clinical setting,
 metastases cannot be excluded.  Uptake in the shoulder is most likely due to
 arthritic degenerative changes.  Abnormal appearance of the bladder could be
 caused by uterine pathology or other pelvic pathology and follow up CT imaging
 is recommend to exclude these possibilities, if clinically indicated.

 The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer
 excretion.

 IMPRESSION:  Several areas of abnormal tracer uptake, which in the clinical
 setting of recently diagnosed metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma, are
 consistent with bony metastases, especially the lesion in the metaphysis of the
 left tibia.  These findings were verbalized to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21952**] on
 [**2161-7-16**].  Incidental finding of bladder contour abnormality/displacement raises
 the possibility of uterine fibroid or other pelvic mass and follow up CT imaging
 is recommended, if clinically indicated.

feversv(Tm 100-101), productive cough and 18 pound weight loss
during this time. At the [**Hospital 11074**] clinic on [**7-8**], a chest x-ray
was done which was significant for mediastinal widening. She was
immediately taken by ambulance to Falumouth ED. At [**Hospital1 1562**], a
Chest CT showed diffuse mediastinal adenopathy and multiple
pulmonary nodules and splenomegaly. An echo showed small-
moderate pericardial effusion and increased tuerculation in RV
apex c/w RVA thrombus. NL EF/valves. Doppler US LE - Left
popliteal DVT. V/Q scan - indetermingate - 50% chance of PE.
Patient was stable during one day admission at [**Hospital1 1562**] and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further work up of the pulmonary
nodules and lymphadenopathy.  While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was
seen by pulmonary and oncology. She was sent for a chest and
abdominal CT which suggested a 5x4 cm mediastinal mass with
precarinal lymph nodes, multiple smaller nodules throughout both
lungs and a small-moderate pericardial effusion. She was
hemodynamically stable in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and transferred to the floors
on [**7-10**] pm.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no axillary
lymphadenopathy. Small
axillary lymph nodes do not meet the criteria for pathologic
enlargement and
measure up to 6 mm in size. A large mediastinal mass, which
measures up to
5.4 x 4.7 cm in axial dimension, which extends from the right
paratracheal
region at the level of the thoracic inlet to the precarinal
lesion is present
with central regions of hypodensity suggesting necrotic change.
In addition,
there is an enlarged 4.5 x 2.5 cm subcarinal lymph node.
Bulkiness in the
right hilum is present as well. Evaluation of the central
airways demonstrate
patency to the segmental bronchi bilaterally. Examination of the
lung windows
demonstrate a dominant 13 x 11 mm nodule within the right upper
lobe, with a
satellite lesion in the subpleural right apex measuring 7 mm in
size. Most of
these lesions show some characteristics of spiculation. In
addition, there is
a 5 mm nodular region in the subpleural right lower lobe, which
has well-
defined forbers. The right lower lobe demonstrates mild
atelectasis, possibly
with a smaller degree of consolidation as well. There is a trace
right-sided
pleural effusion. The left lung is essentially clear, without
evidence of
pleural effusion. There are some peripheral blebs suggestive of
paraseptal
emphysema. Note is also made of a hypodense appearance of the
blood relative
to myocardium suggestive of anemia. There is a small pericardial
effusion.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Allowing for the noncontrast
technique,
the liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, stomach, and small
bowel appear
unremarkable. The pancreas is grossly unremarkable as well.
Adrenal glands
are not clearly visualized due to the lack of IV contrast, and
no bulky
lymphadenopathy is the retroperitoneum or mesentery is noted.
There is no
abdominal free fluid present.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The large bowel and bladder
are
unremarkable. Distal ureters are not well visualized without IV
contrast. The
uterus is not seen, and the ovaries appear unremarkable.

Examination of the osseous structures show no suspicious lytic
or blastic
lesions.

IMRESSION:
1. Large mediastinal mass with precarinal and subcarinal lymph
nodes. These
have hypodense central regions suggestive or necrosis. These
would be most
ammenable for transbronchial biopsy.
2. Multiple lung nodules, two of which are spiculated at the
right lung apex.
3. There is a small pericardial effusion.

[**2161-7-11**]
MRI BRAIN.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with history of cervical cancer
with pulmonary
nodule and mediastinal mass and patient allergic to IV contrast
for CT, for
further evaluation to exclude metastatic disease.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial, and FLAIR, T2 and
susceptibility axial
images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium. T1 axial,
sagittal and
coronal images were obtained following the administration of
gadolinium.

FINDINGS: In the right posterofrontal lobe, there are two small
areas of
signal abnormality seen within on the FLAIR images, one
laterally along the
anterior aspect of the central sulcus and the second superiorly
to the
posterior frontal lobe near the midline. Both of these foci
demonstrate
enhancement following the administration of gadolinium. No other
focal
abnormalities are identified. Specifically, no evidence of
periventricular
signal abnormalities are seen. No other areas of enhancement are
noted. The
ventricles and extraaxial spaces are normal in size. No evidence
for midline
shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus is seen.

IMPRESSION: Foci of signal abnormalities in the right frontal
lobe with
enhancement. The differential diagnosis includes metastatic
disease and
demyelinating process, given patient's age. However, given the
clinical
history and the location of the lesions, metastatic disease is
considered more
likely.


Brief Hospital Course:
37 year old female with h/o cervical cancer s/p TAH transferred
from outside hospital with progressive chest discomfort, SOB,
and weight loss with Left popliteal DVT, possible PE and chest
xray/ CT evidence of mediastinal mass and multiple bilateral
nodules with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

1. Pulmonary nodules - On admission a chest xray suggested a
small focal opacity in right upper lobe and right paratracheal
opacity. A chest CT the following day suggested a large
mediastinal mass with precarinal and subcarinal lymph nodes with
hypodense central regions suggestive of necrosis. It also showed
multiple nodules, two spiculated lung nodules at right lung
apex. These lesions were most consistent with lung cancer versus
lymphoma so a mediastinoscopy was planned. Other things
originally on the differential were: TB -PPD negative,
histoplasmosis -antigen still pending, coccidoiomycoses,
nocardia, sarcoidosis (scandinavian) - ACE-normal. On [**7-11**] she
had a MRI-brain, which showed two foci of signal abnormalities
in the right frontal lobe with enhancement. No edema or mass
effect was seen secondary to the brain lesions. On [**7-13**], she had
a mediastinoscopy. The frozen section was positive for non-small
cell lung cancer; paratracheal lymph nodes were sent for
pathology (still pending).

2. Non-small cell lung cancer - Multiple necrotic lymph nodes
radiographically and grossly, MRI of the brain with focal right
frontal brain mets; and a 1 by 1 inch paraspinal hard, rubbery
lesion on her Left upper back; presentation consistent with
metastatic NSCLC. Patient was told her diagnosis with her mother
and grandfather in the room. She seemed to take the news well,
appropriately becoming teary eyed. She was then seen by a social
worker and told the social worker that she was coping well and
did not need to be seen anymore. She was seen by oncology
consult and set up for
an outpatient follow up with multidisciplinary oncology team on
thursday [**7-16**]. During that time she will discuss chemo vs
biologic therapies vs palliation.
She will also have a bone scan to evaluate for bone mets also on
thursday as an o/p. On the last day of admission, the patient
noted blurriness in left periphery; no deficit on visual fields
or neuro exam; the patient was advised to have a head ct to
reevaluate for mass effect or bleeding in the brain lesions, but
she refused and wanted to go home with no further treatment. She
was counseled to go to the ED if she had worsening vision
deficits, headaches. The patient's shortness of breath was
stable during the admission; she required 2L oxygen especially
during long conversations; the patient will be sent home on home
oxygen.

2. Hypercoagulable state - DVT/PE/?RV thrombus - echo at outside
hospital also with possible thrombus in RV; pt obviously
hypercoagulable most likely secondary to primary lung
malignancy; she was maintained on heparin throughout the
admission and was switched to Lovenox and underwent Lovenox
administration teaching prior to discharge

3. Pericardial effusion - found on echo at [**Hospital1 **]; stable on
chest CT at [**Hospital1 18**].Most likely secondary to the primary lung
malignancy; patient did not experience any decreases in blood
pressure, increased shortness of breath, or increased chest pain
during the admission. SHe was monitored throughout the admission
for tamponade physiology and did not present with any.

4. Fevers - low grade throughout admission; most likely
secondary to the malignancy; fungal, blood cultures were
negative; lyme antibody was negative; patient never mounted an
increased white blood cell count.

5. Pain/Nausea - The patient had back and chest (pleural) pain
throughout the admission well controlled PRN dilaudid q 3-4
hours. She was started on a fentanyl patch for pain on [**2161-7-13**]
with dilaudid for breakthrough. SHe also noted increased nausea
with the dilaudid which was well controlled with phenergan.
After the mediastinoscopy, she had increased throat pain which
was relieved with viscous lidocaine.

6. 10 year hisory of perimenopausal symptoms - FSH, LH within
normal limits; no further work-up during the admission

7. PPX - She was maintained on a multivitamin and zantac during
the admission with colace and senna to releive constipation in
the setting of narcotics.)

 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.

 Right PICC line has been withdrawn substantially since the prior study, with
 tip now terminating in the expected location at the junction of the right
 subclavian and right brachiocephalic veins.  Cardiac silhouette is difficult
 to assess due to obscuration of right heart border by right middle lobe
 process.  Left heart border and remaining mediastinal contours are stable.
 Patchy left infrahilar opacity is without change.  A moderate-to-large right
 pleural effusion is again demonstrated and probably similar in size allowing
 for semi-upright versus upright positioning on the prior and current study
 respectively.  There is new abnormality in the right middle lobe, most likely
 due to atelectasis in the setting of a large adjacent effusion, but other
 underlying process including infection is not excluded.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion.  New right middle lobe opacity,
 which may be due to atelectasis or pneumonia.
 2.  Persistent left infrahilar opacity, most likely atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for exploratory
laparotomy, right
adrenalectomy and right hepatic segment 6 resection. Please see
operative report for details. EBL was 3 liters. An introp U/S
revealed- liver echogenicity appeared unremarkable. Within the
posterior segment of the right lobe of the liver, there was s a
5.5 x 3.3 cm well- circumscribed, slightly hypoechoic lesion
that contained a degree of increased through transmission
suggesting at least some cystic components. The relationship of
this to the surrounding vasculature, particularly the posterior
branch of the right portal vein was demonstrated. No other
additional lesions were found.Two [**Doctor Last Name **] drains were removed by
postop day 5. Pathology returned positive for 1. Right adrenal
mass, excision (A-F):
Malignant neoplasm most consistent with adrenal cortical
carcinoma, see note.
2. Liver segment six, resection (G-O):
Malignant neoplasm most consistent with adrenal cortical
carcinoma, see note. Endocrinology was to follow and the plan
was to use ________ as an outpatient.

Postop she was in the SICU for fluid management and ATN.
Baseline creatinine was 0.6. Nephrology was consulted.
Creatinine trended down to 1.1 by POD 8. Renal u/s was normal.
Stress dose steroids were given preop and postop per
Endocrinology. Endocrinology preferred a slow 6 month steroid
taper. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] tapered prednisone after one week as she
developed an incision infection necessitating opening the
incision and using a wound vac.  A CT of the abd was done on
which demonstrated Two ill-defined fluid collections
post-surgical site that were extrahepatic and could represent
postoperative seromas, bilomas, or less likely abscesses.
Multiple scattered foci of air, likely postoperative. 2.
Increased stranding about the head of the pancreas, possibly
pancreatitis. 3. Bibasilar atelectasis and small right pleural
effusion. Amylase and lipase were normal. LFTs preop were ast
1298, alt 1308, alk phos 64 and tbili 0.7. These trended down
postop with the exception of the alk phos which increased to as
high as 806 on HD 20. Subsequently, this has decreased some to
504 as of [**11-13**].

She required PICC line placement for IV antibiotics and TPN as
her kcals were insufficient. Her appetite was diminished. She
appeared apathetic on many days and expressed feelings of
sadness. Psychiatry saw her and agreed with the team that she
was experiencing intermittent delerium. There was concern that
she was experiencing the effects of less cortisol. Neurology
recommended a CT and EEG.  A head CT was done for waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**]
mental status. This was negative for bleed/mass on [**10-29**]. An EEG
was performed which demonstrated mild encephalopathy. TSH was
3.4.  Psychiatry did not recommend antidepressents or stimulants
at the time.

On CT a right pleural effusion was noted. She experienced desats
and sob. Pleuracentesis was performed on [**11-6**] (HD 20)with a
negative culture. A f/u cxr was improved and without
pneumothorax.

She developed a Klebsiella uti which was treated with Cipro and
Flagyl for the wound x 4 days. These antibiotics were switched
to Vanco and Meropenum when a wound culture identified strep
veridans, sparse yeast, Klebsiella which was pan sensitive and
staph coag positive resistent to levo/oxicillin/penicillin and
sensitive to vanco. Vanco levels were monitored. Creatinine
remained stable. She developed a 2nd UTI,yeast which was treated
with a GU Ampho bladder irrigant x3 days. This was due to finish
on [**11-13**] pm. Repeat u/a and cx were sent on [**11-13**].

A repeat abd CT revealed stable appearance of hepatic fluid
collections with some debris and air in the surgical bed.
Bibasilar atelectasis with stable right pleural effusion.
Stable appearance of right abdominal wall defect overlying
surgical site. Interval development of nonocclusive thrombus
within the intrahepatic inferior vena cava. She was started on
coumadin and IV heparin until she was therapeutic. INR Goal was
[**1-31**]. INR on [**11-13**] was 2.6

On [**11-12**] after taking off the vac and reviewing the CT, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**]
drain was inserted thru the wound into a peri-hepatic collection
and placed to bulb suction.  Water soluble contrast was
administered at the bedside through this catheter. Contrast was
administered. Contrast was seen surrounding this wound and
draining along the right lateral aspect of the wound into
dressing, however, no definite communication into the abdominal
cavity noted. Midline chevron scar and multiple clips scattered
across the abdomen were seen. Remainder of abdomen was gasless.
Small amount of oral contrast seen in the rectum.  She then
underwent successful drainage catheter placement in collection
in the subhepatic and hepatic areas on [**2194-11-12**].

The plan is for her to go to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on TPN via a R picc
with a RUQ incision wound vac. She has 2 hepatic drains to
gravity drainage and meropenum/vanco will continue until next
week. She will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**11-17**] and
with endocrinology as an outpatient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old
male smoker with diabetes, and hypertension, and hepatitis C,
and status post anterior myocardial infarction who presented
with anterior myocardial infarction.

At midnight on the day prior to admission, the patient
experienced substernal chest pain while sitting at rest in
his bed.  The pain was radiating to his arms.  It was
described as not pleuritic.  It was associated with shortness
of breath.  The patient took sublingual nitroglycerin without
relief.  The pain lasted 10 minutes until Emergency Medical
Service arrived.  He was found to be hypertensive at 210/100.

The patient was brought to [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department.  Electrocardiogram showed sinus
rhythm at 54, normal axis, and normal intervals.  ST
elevations were noted to be 1 mm to 2 mm in leads V2 through
V5 and aVL.  Reciprocal ST depressions of 2 mm were seen in
leads II, III, and aVF.  The patient's electrocardiogram also
showed poor R wave progression.

The patient was taken to the Catheterization Laboratory.  He
was randomized to cool myocardial infarction protocol.  On
catheterization, the patient was found to have left main
coronary artery without flow-limiting lesions.  A 50% mid
distal lesion was seen in the left anterior descending artery
along with an occluded first diagonal that was stented.  The
left circumflex, right coronary artery, and ramus intermedius
were found to be normal.  Pulmonary artery saturation was
75%.  Pulmonary artery pressure was 27/11.  Per the protocol,
the patient was cooled to 33 degrees for five hours.  He was
started on aspirin, Integrilin, and Plavix and received a
heparin bolus.  He was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for
monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient reports he smoked half a pack
per day for 40 years for a total of a 20-pack-year smoking
history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination
on admission revealed heart rate was 48, blood pressure
was 123/55, saturating 99% on room air.  The patient was
found to have dry mucous membranes.  No jugular venous
distention.  A regular rhythm.  Normal first heart sound and
second heart sound.  No murmurs.  The lungs were clear.  No
hematomas in the groin.  Extremities had bounding dorsalis
pedis pulses.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Complete blood
count and Chemistry-7 were within normal limits as were
coagulations.  Creatine kinase was 193.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:  The patient was started on
aspirin, and Plavix (for a 30-day course), and Integrilin
drip (for 18 hours).  The team did not start the patient on a
statin as he has a history of hepatitis C.

Liver function tests were normal with an AST of 36, ALT
was 118, alkaline phosphatase was 96, total bilirubin
was 0.5.

A cholesterol panel was as follows:  Total cholesterol
was 181, low-density lipoprotein was 102, high-density
lipoprotein was 30, triglycerides were 231.

An echocardiogram was done and revealed an ejection fraction
to be normal at 55%.  There was mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.  There was
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal hypokinesis of the apex.  Also of note, mild aortic
sclerosis.

A beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were titrated to blood
pressure and heart rate control.  A hemoglobin A1c was found
to be 5.4.  Therefore, the patient was determined not to be a
diabetic.

 TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale ultrasonography, color Doppler ultrasound
 examination, and analysis of spectral Doppler waveforms were performed at the
 level of the graft as well as the native arteries downstream and upstream.

 This showed a patent bypass, with a proximal diameter of 0.60 cm and a distal
 diameter of 0.58 cm. The peak systolic velocities are measured at 122
 cm/second in the native left common femoral artery, 157 cm/second at the
 proximal bypass anastomosis, values ranging between 35 cm/second and 58
 cm/second in the graft itself, 81 cm/second at the distal bypass anastomosis,
 and 77 cm/ second in the native anterior tibial artery, beyond the bypass.

 CONCLUSION: Patent left SFA to [**Doctor First Name **] bypass, without any significant stenosis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired and had been living
at home with his wife prior to his admission to the hospital
on [**2101-10-11**]; he had been living at [**Hospital3 1761**] for the day prior to admission.  He is a
social drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;
although, he quit smoking 20 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical
examination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,
heart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following
administration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory
was 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There
were normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were
hypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft
pulse, [**Hospital3 17394**] dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis
pulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,
and intact.  Please note that the above examination was done
by the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was
initially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial
laboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell
count of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets
were 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR
was 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,
potassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood
urea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose
was 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and
phosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were
pending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on
admission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out
yeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also
initially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated
stable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no
focal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of
the chest compared with a [**2101-10-15**] study.  No
radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or
pneumonia.

His admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,
nonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages
in the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when
compared with an electrocardiogram dated [**2101-10-12**].

An initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination
that demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No
evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,
incompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple
left renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and
partially calcified prostate gland.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to
the Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased
urine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary
to a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were
never any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).

While boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the
night of admission, the patient had a sudden
cardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with
epinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion
times four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.

Following these measures, the patient returned to a sinus
rhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;
the total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to
the return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He
subsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood
pressure.

An echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a
trivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a
hyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided
filling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this
arrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were
elevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.

A repeat echocardiogram done on [**2101-10-21**]
demonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction
of 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities
including inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular
akinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and
moderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study
of [**2101-10-20**]; the left ventricular function was
unchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the
right ventricular function appeared worse.

On [**2101-10-21**], the patient was loaded with amiodarone
and was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The
following day, he was started on heparin intravenously given
his elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this
medication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated
troponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient
was a candidate for cardiac catheterization.

After discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit
team and the patient's family, however, the decision was made
to not pursue further invasive procedures given that the
patient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate
following the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family
no longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.

By [**2101-10-23**], he was off pressors and he was
restarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.

On the evening of [**2101-10-25**], the patient complained
of substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and
morphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3
that reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.
Therefore, the patient was again started on heparin;
although, this was discontinued on [**2101-10-26**] when
the patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac
enzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on [**2101-10-27**]; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he
again ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac
enzymes.

By hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence
of congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid
resuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.
By the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service
on [**2101-10-26**], the patient was still significantly
volume overloaded following his aggressive fluid
resuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,
he was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that
he was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive
heart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of
his discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was
greater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on
gentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the
levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already
taking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to
admission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative
urosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous
fluids.

On [**2101-10-21**], his levofloxacin and metronidazole was
discontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the
growth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of
gentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was
discontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious
Disease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on
[**2101-10-28**], and his piperacillin/tazobactam was
discontinued on [**2101-10-29**].

Despite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis
precipitating this admission, the patient did not have any
positive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of
yeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained
afebrile both before and after discontinuation of his
antibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile
negative on [**2101-10-28**].

3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and
he was extubated on [**2101-10-24**].  He subsequently
developed wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to
cardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his
aggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed
toward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his
he was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%
on 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium
nebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his
respiratory secretions.

4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure
and prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid
resuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum
creatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.

5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly
malnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once
he was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and fevers.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old
female with a history of human immunodeficiency virus (last
CD4 count 42 and a viral load of 65,000), cirrhosis,
diabetes, and hypothyroidism presented with eight days of
fevers to 104, chills, shortness of breath, cough, dyspnea on
exertion, and fatigue.

The patient states she has become progressively dyspneic to
the point where she is short of breath with speaking.  She
has also had night sweats for the past two days and whitish
sputum.  She complains of myalgias.  No recent ill contacts.
[**Name (NI) **] known tuberculosis exposure.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was initially 96% on
room air, with a respiratory rate of 20, and a heart rate of
117.  A chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial opacities.
She received 3 liters of normal saline, clindamycin, and
primaquine for likely Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  She
spiked a temperature to 102.1 and became progressively
dyspneic with her respiratory rate increasing to 40, and her
oxygen saturations dropping to 89% on room air.  She was
placed on 6 liters by nasal cannula, and an arterial blood
gas showed 7.47/28/74.  The patient was given prednisone and
aztreonam for possible cholangitis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission, the
patient had a temperature of 102.1, her heart rate was 118,
her respiratory rate was 40, her blood pressure was 117/57,
and her oxygen saturation was 89% on room air and 94% on 6
liters.  In general, she was ill and toxic appearing.  She
was unable to speak in complete sentences.  She was
cachectic.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed anicteric.  The mucous membranes were dry.  The
extraocular movements were intact.  No thrush.  The neck was
supple.  There was no jugular venous distention.  Thorax
revealed bilateral basilar rales.  No wheezes.
Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia.  There were

nerves II through XII were intact.  Strength was [**5-18**] in all
extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had
a white blood cell count of 9.7 (with 89% neutrophils and 7%
lymphocytes), and her hematocrit was 34.2.  Chemistries were
within normal limits with a blood urea nitrogen of 9 and a
creatinine of 0.5.  Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,
her alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase
was 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct
bilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was
negative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive
for 30 protein.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed
sinus tachycardia; unchanged from [**2187**].

A chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in
the left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia or viral pneumonia.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.
No gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient
was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit secondary
to respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a
respectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with
possible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.

Given her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was
started on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage
with primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on
prednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her
low PAO2.

In the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive
positive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed
with 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears
were negative.

The patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her
medication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive
positive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to
saturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on
primaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of
antibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.

2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from
admission from [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] grew out
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ([**4-19**] blood
cultures).  At that time, the patient was started on
vancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood
cultures.

A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out
endocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;
although, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her
peripherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent
surveillance blood cultures from [**3-17**] on were negative,
and the patient was to be continued on vancomycin
intravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood
cultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient
remained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.

3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class
cirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in [**2190-10-13**].  Her
cirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active
antiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**]
in [**2191-4-14**] for a visit.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the
patient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and
was within normal limits.

4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was
restarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen
on hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these
medications without any problems.  She was also continued on
acyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20066**] in clinic over the next two
weeks.

5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on
original regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary
to her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated
while in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her
Lantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the
morning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with
improved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units
of Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the
next three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which
time her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,
and her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.

6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her
Levoxyl.

7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter
line was placed on [**2191-3-19**] for intravenous antibiotics.
It was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was
pulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the
superior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted
central catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her
course of intravenous vancomycin.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] for cirrhosis and with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 20066**] for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to
follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4390**] next
Friday for primary care.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Prednisone 40 mg once per day times three days; then 20
mg once per day times 11 days.
 2.  Acyclovir 200 mg by mouth twice per day.
 3.  Fluconazole 200 mg by mouth twice per day.
 4.  Primaquine 26.3 two tablets by mouth every day (times 14
days).
 5.  Levoxyl 25 mcg by mouth once per day.
 6.  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg by mouth once per
day.
 7.  Lamivudine 300 mg twice per day.
 8.  Didanosine 400 mg by mouth once per day.
 9.  Lantus 12 units subcutaneously in the morning times
three days; and then 7 units subcutaneously in the morning.
10.  Regular insulin sliding-scale as directed (per
sliding-scale).
11.  Clindamycin 300 mg by mouth four times per day (times 14
days).
12.  Vancomycin 750 mg intravenously twice per day (times 14
days).
13.  Codeine/guaifenesin syrup 5 cc to 10 cc by mouth q.6h.
as needed.
14.  Klonopin 0.75 mg by mouth in the morning and 0.5 mg by
mouth at hour of sleep.

Service:  NEUROLOGY

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Weakness, inability to talk.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old
African-American male with a history of hypertension who was
in his usual state of health until about 10:25 a.m. on the
morning of admission.  He had gone to use the restroom and a
few minutes later his family found him slumped onto the
floor, apparently unable to talk and with weakness in his
right arm and leg.  EMS was called and he was brought into
the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 18**].

The patient has not had strokes or previous similar symptoms.
He has a history of hypertension but no history of cardiac
symptoms.  The patient was unable to talk for examination and
no family members were present at the bedside and were not at
home (apparently they were on the way to the Emergency Room).
The history was obtained by EMS.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on no medications
upon admission.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives [**Location (un) 6409**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  During the five minute
examination, the patient became progressively less responsive
and then vomited requiring intubation and paralytics during
the examination.  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 229/137, heart
rate 85, respiratory rate 20, temperature 98.8.  General:
This was a well-developed African-American male.  HEENT:  The
neck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,
or gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.
Neurologic:  On the mental status examination, the patient
was alert but nonverbal.  Language was aphasic but can
comprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of
neglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the
cranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.
His extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were
equal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at
rest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.
His power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and
leg was apparently [**5-5**].  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious
stimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal
throughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.  Coordination
and gait examination was not tested.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 45,
platelets 258,000.  PT 12.7, PTT 21.7, INR 1.1.

The EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 99 with normal axis and
intervals.  LVH was noted.  There were T wave inversions in
I, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.

Serum and urine toxicology was negative.  ESR was 18.  The
urinalysis was negative.  CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55
by 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to
the right.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed
secondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood
pressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep
the cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was
then weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a
nicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load
followed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has
been therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and
angiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but
the patient's renal function and health status did not allow
such studies to be done at the current time.

Repeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in
the bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral
edema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's
neurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he
only had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal
reflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he
began to not move any extremities and not respond to any
noxious stimuli in the four extremities.

By 4:00 p.m. on [**2149-11-13**], his neurological condition
deteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and
nonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were
done at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery
was reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt
that the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in
that it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along
with hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt
to decrease the cerebral edema.

Despite clinical examination that the patient is clinically
brain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive
treatment.  The family requested that the patient be
transferred to the [**Hospital6 1129**].  However,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54029**] at the [**Hospital3 **] Stroke Service said
that the patient would not be accepted at the [**Hospital3 **] given that there would be no other intervention that
would be done differently at [**Hospital3 **].

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was
initially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood
pressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off
the Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene
drip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.
Labetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and
found to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a
myocardial infarction.

3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when
first seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection
since he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia
on the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and
Flagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.
Vancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization
due to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus
coagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.
Susceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one
or two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials
and increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to
decongest him, saline nasal spray was started.

4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.
The patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued
to rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine
electrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1
which is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and
prerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his
creatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done
which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.

5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration
pneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and
Flagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures
were obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four
blood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.
Since this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics
were given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,
his sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus
coagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More
blood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.

6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric
tube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube
feeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote
GI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.

7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The
patient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130
on the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this
was due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was
then fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure
secondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that
he needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall
hyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 MR OF THE HEAD

 INDICATION:  50-year-old female with GBM, rule out progression or new lesions.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1, T2, and T1 post-gadolinium images of the brain
 were obtained.

 Comparison is made to the prior MRI performed on [**2178-4-22**].

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior MRI, there has been a right frontoparietal
 craniectomy with herniation of the brain tissue through the craniectomy
 defect.  There has been partial resection of the previously noted ring
 enhancing lesion.  There is now hemorrhage within the surgical tract within
 the temporal lobe.  In addition, there is still residual enhancement extending
 from the surface of the parietal lobe inferiorly and medially to reach the
 splenium of the corpus callosum as well as the ependymal surface of the right
 lateral ventricle.  There is apparent enhancement of the ependymal surface,
 suggestive of subependymal spread of tumor.  There still remains mass effect
 upon the right lateral ventricle, relatively unchanged.

 Also since the prior MRI, there is a new burr hole in the left parietal bone.
 The left temporal lesion is again noted and now demonstrates increased
 interval enhancement as compared to the prior study.  In addition, there is a
 T2 hyperintense lesion within the left occipital lobe which does not
 demonstrate post-gadolinium enhancement and primarily involves the white
 matter but does extend to the cortical surface in some portions.  No new
 lesions are identified.  There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or
 hydrocephalus.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Postoperative changes in the right frontoparietal region with partial
 resection of the ring enhancing lesion.  There is now postoperative hemorrhage
 with some residual enhancement extending along the surgical bed to involve the
 splenium of the corpus callosum as well as the ependymal surface of the right
 lateral ventricle.
 2.  Increased enhancement of left temporal lobe lesion.
 3.  T2 hyperintense lesion in the left occipital lobe without post-gadolinium
 enhancement, unchanged.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 50 year old female presents after having fallen in the
bathtub 4 days ago and hitting the back of her head. Since then
she has had a ""massive headache"" which did not resolve with
Tylenol. She states that she has a high threshold for pain and
did not realize how bad it was during the day while at work but
then when she got home at night she noticed it. The patient
noticed ""silvery spects"" in her vision and she had trouble with
some simple tasks like finding the tags on the back of her
clothing in the morning. She reported that she had to check
several times to make sure she did not put her clothes on
backwards. She has had some dizziness, but no nausea or
vomiting.
Her speech has not been affected.

CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN

HISTORY: Brain mass. Now has headache. Evaluate for any changes.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT scan.

COMPARISON STUDY: [**2178-4-17**] CT scan of the head, reported
by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 21881**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] as revealing ""unchanged mass
effect and edema around large right parietal mass, without
evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage following biopsy.""

FINDINGS: Since the prior study, there is now mild linear
hyperdensity within the basal cisterns of this could be
hemorrhage, occasionally the tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]
can be somewhat denser appearing, in the setting of increased
intracranial pressure, which would mimic the presence of
subarachnoid blood.

No other new intracranial or extracranial abnormalities are
discerned.

CONCLUSION: Possible small amount of subarachnoid blood or
relatively stagnant vascular flow, in the face of increased
intracranial pressure, as noted above. We have telephoned (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] with this report immediately after the conclusion of the
study.

ADDENDUM: There is a tiny residual gas collection superior to
the biopsy site, definitely decreased in extent compared to the
prior study of [**4-17**].

EMERGENCY MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN.

HISTORY: Ring-enhancing brain mass with edema seen on CT scan.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted brain images with
gadolinium enhancement.

COMPARISON STUDIES: None available at this time.

WET READ REPORT: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 71796**] interpreted this study as
revealing ""bilateral parenchymal masses, suggesting metastatic
disease. The largest mass in the right parietal lobe has a
complex appearance, at least 5 cm in greatest dimension with at
least 8 cm greatest dimension of surrounding edema and 7 mm
leftward midline shift."" Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 71796**] is a member of the
""Nighthawk"" Radiology group.

FINDINGS: The study indeed reveals a large right parietal,
irregularly thick ring enhancing mass, possibly with some tiny
""daughter"" cystic components extending towards the cortical
surface. As mentioned in the wet [**Location (un) 1131**], there is a substantial
area of surrounding edema, with effacement of the right atrium
and approximately 7 mm leftward subfalcine herniation. A smaller
area of edema is seen within the white matter of the left
occipital lobe, but I cannot delineate any specific area of
enhancement associated with it. A third, very well circumscribed
18 x 26 mm area of elevated T2 signal is seen contiguous to the
left temporal lobe, and it is difficult to determine whether the
lesion is intra- or extra-axial in locale. Again, there is no
associated enhancement and no abnormal susceptibility is noted,
either. On the coronal post-contrast images, there is a
questionable area of enhancement, approximately 3 mm,
immediately subjacent to the left temporal lesion- I am not
certain that the two findings are necessarily related. The
principal vascular flow patterns are identified. There is no
overt extracranial abnormality noted.

CONCLUSION: Large right parietal lobe mass, which may represent
either a primary or metastatic brain neoplasm. The additional
abnormalities within the left temporal lobe and left occipital
lobe, while they may represent extremely unusual manifestations
of metastatic disease, which would then render the right
parietal lobe lesion more likely metastatic, could have
alternative diagnoses, including hemorrhage or a calcified left
temporal meningioma as an explanation for the left temporal
lesion, and either an inflammatory or ischemic process to
account for the left occipital lesion. I discussed this case
this morning with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided that a non-contrast
head CT scan would be a helpful followup diagnostic procedure to
further characterize the left cerebral hemispheric lesions prior
to brain biopsy of the right parietal lesion.

*******

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 50 year-old woman without significant PMH who presented
[**2178-4-16**] from OSH with new dx of brain mass after fall, with
biopsy that showed GBM, for which she had craniectomy/debulking
[**2178-4-23**] and was started on XRT without event.
.
1) Glioblastoma Multiforme: She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after
fall and was noted to have a brain mass. She had a biopsy which
showed glioblastoma, WHO grade IV. She was noted on [**4-21**] to have
headache, with 4/18 she had mental status changes and imaging
c/w herniation. She was taken emergently to the OR [**4-23**] for
craniotomy and subtotal tumor debulking. She was then
transferred to Omed for XRT and chemotherapy. She was maintained
on keppra and decadron for seizure/cerebral edema prevention.
She was maintained on seizure precautions with frequent neuro
checks. She used a helmet with ambulation given s/p craniectomy.
She was started on XRT with temador. She remained stable without
signs of elevated intracranial pressure during this so was
thought stable to go home and continue XRT as an outpatient. She
was seen by PT and though stable to go home. She was continued
on pantoprazole and sliding scale insulin while on
dexamethasone.

Date of Birth:   [**2127-2-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiac surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 39-year-old woman with
diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obesity, with a
one to two months of chest burning with exertion. For the
past six months, she has been participating in a new vigorous
exercise program to lose weight. Her symptoms do gradually
resolve with rest, but they have started to occur now with
walking. She does acknowledge that there is associated
nausea, diaphoresis and shortness of breath. Now recently she
started to get symptoms for the past two days while at rest.
She was referred for an outpatient exercise tolerance test,
where she had chest pain and significant EKG changes. She was
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization today, which
revealed significant left main artery disease. Just prior to
her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she did complain of chest pain and
back pain at about 7/10 intensity and a nitroglycerin drip
was started and she received 5 mg of IV Lopressor and 2 mg of
IV Ativan, which did resolve her pain. While she was in the
cath lab, she had an intraaortic balloon pump placed, and now
she is not actively complaining of any pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any orthopnea, lower extremity
edema, but she does acknowledge that she does have
dysmenorrhea.

PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:  She has diabetes mellitus, type 2,
diagnosed in [**2157**]. She has been able to control it with diet
since [**2166-6-22**]; hypertension and obesity; however, she has
lost 40 pounds in the last six months.

SHE HAS AN ALLERGY TO SHELLFISH.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFERS TO [**Hospital1 18**]:  Atenolol 50 mg a day,
lisinopril 10 mg a day, Lipitor 20 mg a day, aspirin 325 mg
once a day, progesterone, nitroglycerin drip, Lopressor,
Ativan.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke. She does not use ethanol
and she does not use cocaine. Her father had a brain tumor.
Her brother did have coronary artery disease and a myocardial
infarction in his late 30s. Her mother has hypertension. She
does have a strong family history for hyperlipidemia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is comfortable appearing,
in no apparent distress. Vital signs: Temperature 99.1, pulse
72, blood pressure 144/87. Pulse oximetry is 98% on room air.
Head and neck: PERRLA. EOMI. Anicteric. Mucous membranes
moist. Neck supple, no lymphadenopathy, no JVD. Cardiac:
Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, but
she is morbidly obese, positive bowel sounds. Her extremities
are warm, no edema. She has got 5/5 strength in all
extremities.

Her laboratories prior to admission from [**Hospital3 1280**] were
white count 7.4, hematocrit of 39.8, platelets 190,000.
Hemoglobin A1c was 7.1. Sodium was 140, potassium 4.1,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 28, BUN 14, creatinine 0.6. Total
cholesterol was 307, triglycerides were 79, and HDL was 50.

[**Last Name (STitle) 54218**], which was at [**Hospital3 1280**] (it was not at
[**Hospital1 18**]), showed diffuse left main and proximal left anterior
descending artery stenosis, 60% to 70%, which was ulcerative;
50% mid LAD stenosis; 50% left circumflex stenosis after OM1;
moderate right coronary artery stenosis; a normal ejection
fraction of 78%; no mitral regurgitation. Note that the right
coronary artery stenosis that I am reported is different than
what was actually reported on the initial catheterization
results from [**Hospital3 1280**]. This was discussed between Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**], and was not actually considered to be
80% as previously reported.

So this was a woman who was considered to have unstable
angina but not actively ischemic. She was put on an
intraaortic balloon pump, followed in the cardiac care unit,
and was ""preoped"" and consented for a CABG on the next day
because of her three-vessel disease. She was made n.p.o.
after midnight and then in the morning she was taken to the
operating room.

On[**Last Name (STitle) 19203**] of [**2167-1-9**], Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] went to the
operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for bypass surgery.
Please refer to the previously dictated operative note by Dr.
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for the specifics of this surgery. In brief,
three grafts were made. One was a left internal mammary to
the left anterior descending artery and then two saphenous
vein grafts were connected to the OM1 and OM2. She was on
cardiopulmonary bypass for 76 minutes and the aorta was cross
clamped for 53 of those minutes.

She tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the
intensive care unit on propofol and Neo-Synephrine drips.

Postoperatively, Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] did extremely well. Her
intraaortic balloon pump and all of her intravenous drips
were discontinued on postoperative day one. On postoperative
day two she was extubated and on postoperative day three she
was transferred to the floor. Ms. [**Known lastname 54219**] major floor issues
were as follows.

Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] was followed by physical therapy, which cleared
her to go home with home physical therapy to assist with
mobility, strength and endurance. She was also actively
diuresed with Lasix and had her potassium repleted
accordingly. Finally, she was noted to have hyperglycemia
while she resumed her regular diet. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8392**] consultation
was obtained and they recommended metformin 500 mg twice a
day to maintain euglycemia. She would follow her sugar as an
outpatient and report this back in an outpatient followup
appointment.

On [**1-14**] the patient's central line was discontinued.
She was scheduled to leave, but she developed chest pain;
however, this chest pain was considered not to be cardiac, to
be more gastrointestinal in nature, and she had ......... and
an EKG, both of which confirmed a noncardiac source for this
chest pain.

She is, therefore, on [**1-15**], postoperative day six,
being discharged home in good condition with home physical
therapy scheduled.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Obesity.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Unstable angina.
6.  Three-vessel coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass grafting, status post intraaortic
balloon pump.
7.  Hypokalemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 100 mg t.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week.
6.  Potassium chloride 10 mEq p.o. b.i.d. for one week.

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65 year old female
with a 20 year history of hypertension and a ten year history
of Type 2 diabetes who demonstrated a positive exercise
stress test in [**2183-3-1**] suggestive for possible coronary
artery disease.  The patient received a stress test as part
of a risk stratification workup and at no point demonstrated
any evidence of chest pain.  A subsequent exercise MIBI study
performed [**2183-3-28**] revealed an exercise capacity of
only 2 minutes 15 seconds on the [**Doctor First Name **] protocol.  There was
no chest pain noted on the test and the peak exercise
electrocardiogram showed 1.5 to 2 mm horizontal to upsloping
ST depression in the inferior leads and in V1 and V2.
Imaging studies revealed a large apical to a small anterior
defect that was reversible.  The patient's ejection fraction
was noted to be 56% with normal wall motion.  The patient
subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2183-4-22**] which demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease
and mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.  The patient was
thereafter referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] for surgical
evaluation and was subsequently scheduled for a coronary
artery bypass graft on [**2183-4-28**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2183-4-28**], the patient underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft times three with grafts from the
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  The patient's pericardium was
left open.  Lines were placed including an arterial line and
a Swan-Ganz catheter ; both atrial and ventricular wires were
placed; tubes placed included in a mediastinal and bilateral
pleural tubes.  The patient was subsequently transferred to
the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, intubated, for further
evaluation and management.  Shortly after arriving in the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, the patient was easily weaned
and extubated without complication.  On postoperative day #1,
the patient was noted to be stable for transfer to the floor
and was subsequently admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service
under the direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].  The patient's
postoperative course was uneventful and she progressed well
clinically.  On postoperative day #1, the patient's chest
tube and Foley catheter were successfully removed without
complications.  Follow up chest x-ray demonstrated no
evidence of pneumothorax, and the patient was noted to be
independently productive of adequate amounts of urine for the
duration of her stay.  Physical therapy performed an initial
evaluation with the patient and followed her progress for the
duration of her stay.  On postoperative day #3, the patient's
pacer wires were removed without complications and her
sternal incision was noted to be clean, dry and intact with
Steri-Strips in place.  The patient was successfully advanced
to a regular diet, which she tolerated well and was noted to
have adequate pain control via oral pain medications.  The
patient steadily advanced in her ability to ambulate freely
and was subsequently cleared for discharge to home by
physical therapy.  The patient was subsequently cleared for
discharge to home on postoperative day #4, [**2183-5-3**], with
instructions for follow up.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is to be discharged to
home with instructions for follow up.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

CT Abd:
LLL PNA
There is a confluent air space opacity within the left lower
lobe consistent with pneumonia. The right lung is grossly clear.
There are no pleural effusions. The liver, gallbladder, spleen,
pancreas, adrenal glands, and right kidney appear grossly
normal. There are at least two (2) tiny low attenuation foci
arising from the left kidney which are too small to characterize
further. Stomach and visualized loops of small and large bowel
are unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or
mesenteric lymph nodes are present. There is no free fluid.

Head CT: There is no intracranial hemorrhage.

C-spine CT: There is no evidence of fracture or dislocation.
There are numerous cervical lymh nodes seen and thickening of
the adenoidal/nasopharyngeal soft tissues. Clinical correlation
recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname 20069**] [**Known lastname 37728**] ia a 20 yo male with h/o bipolar disease,
ADHD, h/o seizures p/w acute hepatitis due to unintentional
percocet overdose.

Acute Hepatitis due to APAP overdose: He was initially admitted
to the SICU where he was evaluated by the liver transplant team.
 Luckily, his ALT/AST trended down with 17 doses of
N-Acetylcysteine from a peak of 22,000/14,00 respectively, and
an INR peak of 6.6.  With his improvement, he was transferred to
the floor on [**4-1**], with continued improvement of his LFT's.  An
abd CT was not surprising, showing expected signs of
inflammation around the liver.  Pt's abdominal pain was
improving on discharge.

Hypertension: in setting of acute hepatitis.  Pt was treated
with clonidine in house with.  Anticipate resolution with
resolution of acute process.

?Bipolar Disease/ADHD: Followed by psychiatry in house.  They
recommend not medically treating his reported diagnoses given pt
could not provide names of any psychiatrists, and the psychiatry
team questioned the pt's diagnoses.  Pt will follow up with
outpatient psychiatry, and was given the number of a psychiatry
practice near his home.

LLL PNA: Likely due to aspiration while pt was acutely sick.  Pt
spiked to 101.9, with evidence of LLL PNA on abd CT.  He was
started on Levo/Flagyl [**4-2**] for 1 week.  He remained comfortable
on room air and afebrile.

? H/O Seizures d/t subdural hemorrhage in setting of CVA in
[**2160**]: Pt reported being on dilantin and depakote for
seizures/mood stabalization.  However, I spoke with both his PCP
and primary neurologist who have no record of him being on
either medication, and no record of him ever having a seizure.
Further, he had an EEG for headaches on [**2163-4-22**] that was normal.
 Pt's dilantin and depakote levels on admission were below
assay.  Pt was not place on either dilantin or depakote.  He
remained seizure free in house and head CT showed no evidence of
subdural hematoma as present three years ago after his car
accident.  He will follow up with outpatient neurology.

Drug seeking behavior: Pt was clearly pain med seeking, being
verbally abusive to staff.  His episode of falling off the
toilet [**4-2**] was likely due to opioid overuse, with no subsequent
evidence of trauma on exam or CT.  With some struggle, we have
negotiated switching him from IV to PO dilaudid.  He will be
d/c'd off dilaudid, with a few oxycodones for breaktrough pain.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST dated [**2199-9-26**].

 HISTORY:  Follow up assessment, status post evacuation of subdural hematoma,
 now with recurrent headache.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous 5 mm axial tomographic sections were obtained from the
 skull base to the vertex and viewed in brain and bone window on the
 workstation.

 FINDINGS:  The study is compared with most recent NECT dated [**9-19**], as well as
 the presentation study, dated [**2199-9-15**].  As before, the patient is status post
 right frontal craniotomy with burr holes and post-surgical changes at the
 craniotomy site.  There are skin staples with a lentiform subgaleal fluid
 collection, and only a small amount of residual pneumocephalus. There is a
 persistent crescentic mixed-attenuation collection, layering over the right
 frontal convexity. This measures roughly 11 mm in maximal thickness from the
 inner table, slightly smaller since the most recent study, with persistent
 flattening of the subjacent gyri.  The degree of leftward shift of the midline
 structures is significantly improved, now measuring 4 mm; there is no evidence
 of significant subfalcine and no uncal herniation.

 Again demonstrated is the ovoid, predominantly low but mixed-attenuation
 lesion, superficially located in the right temporal lobe.  This now measures
 2.3 cm (AP), slightly smaller, and likely represents an evolving contusion,
 uncovered by relief of the ""tamponade"" effect of the original subdural
 hematoma.  Now demonstrated is a posterior-central punctate hyperattenuating
 focus, which appeared more curvilinear on the previous examination, when it
 was thought to represent a vessel, perhaps thrombosed. There is no evidence of
 hemorrhage elsewhere in the brain. Other than the post-surgical changes, no
 osseous abnormality is detected.  The included portions of the paranasal
 sinuses, as well as the mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities, are clear.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Status post right frontal craniotomy with evacuation of subdural hematoma;
 there is a persistent extra-axial collection at the craniotomy site, slightly
 smaller, with stable mass effect on the subjacent frontal convexity and
 improvement in midline shift.  The uncal herniation has resolved.

 2.  Further evolution of the probable contusion involving the superficial
 aspect of the right temporal lobe.  It is slightly smaller overall, with the
 small, now punctate hyperattenuating focus at its posteromedial aspect, likely
 representing retracting residual clot (given its own evolution since the
                                                             (Over)

that cause her to lose her balance, become nauseous, and once
vomit. It feels ""like someone's driving a stake through your
head."" She went to the hospital when she could no longer stand
the pain or the lack of sleep. She found no aggravating or
alleviating factors (?if ice may have helped), no change with
position. She had no preceding trauma, loss of consciousness,
numbness, tingling, weakness, change in speech, difficulty
thinking, bowel or bladder dysfunction, hearing problems, or
diplopia. She feels it is more difficult to see becuase her eyes
are ""running"" more and it hurts to focus, as if she has
sandpaper
over her eyes. She denies fevers or chills.

She presented to an OSH, where she had a HCT and was found to
have a right sided subdural hematoma. She was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED, where she had a repeat HCT and received first
morphine,
then dilaudid for her headache.

Further history became somewhat limited as she became more
somnolent immmediately after receiving the dilaudid.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 20741**] is a 29 year-old
woman with MELAS (mitochondrial encephalo-myopathy with
lactic acidosis and stroke like symptoms) who was brought into
the Emergency Room by her mother for a gradual decline in
mental status over the past week that led to a fall the
had been increasingly agitated and emotional for the past few
days. Family members report that she took her anti-seizure
medication of the next 3-4 days all at once and became
""confused"". The patient remembers falling, but cannot relay the
immediate events prior to and after the fall.

Until recently [**Known firstname **] was driving, working as a greeter at an
mother reports that she has been less able to care for
herself and has had to move back into her mother's house in
the past few weeks.

[**Known firstname **] states that she feels like she is ""going to die"" and
that her ""mother is going to leave,"" but expresses no
intention to harm herself.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  MELAS diagnosed at age 18 after
presenting with poor weight gain, headaches, repeated
seizures.  Prior to these events [**Known firstname **] was enrolled in
college.  [**Known firstname 20742**] mother reports three strokes at age 20, 24
and 29 namely one month ago.  Her mother reports no residual
effects of any of the strokes.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1.  Dilantin 100 t.i.d.  2.
Verapamil 240 q.d.  3.  Vitamin C 500 b.i.d.  4.  Vitamin E
400 IU q.d.  5.  Co-enzyme q 150 q.d.  6.  Riboflavin/calcium
100/40 q.d.  7.  Mebaral 50 q.d.  8.  Klonopin 0.5 t.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol, drugs or tobacco use.  Her
parents are divorced.  She is currently cared for by her
mother and a [**Name (NI) 269**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was afebrile.  She had a blood
pressure of 127/73.  Heart rate of 70 and was sating 100% on
room air.  She was lying in the stretcher and was easily
distracted.  She had an ecchymosis over her left eye and some
perioral dermatitis.  Her abdomen was soft, nontender and
nondistended.  Her fundi were clear.  She was alert and did
not follow commands well.  She knew her name, date and place.
She was able to spell her name forward and backward.  Her
immediate recall was 4 out of 4 with her memory being 0 out
of 4 after 30 seconds.  She was able to repeat sentences,
read name tags and follow two step commands.  She was able to
clap her hands.  She had normal facial sensation.  Her face
was symmetric.  Her hearing was intact and her tongue was
midline.  Her muscle bulk was decreased without hypotonia.
She is moving her extremities spontaneously and on command
and lifted her legs well.  She had no tremor.  Her sensation
was intact to light touch throughout her upper and lower
extremities.  Her toes were down going.  Her lungs were clear
and her heart rate was regular in rhythm and rate with no
murmurs.

LABORATORY:  Her HCG was negative.  Her electrolytes were
normal.  Her Dilantin level was 35.

Head CT showed no acute process.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 20741**] was admitted for observation
given her high Dilantin levels and her mental status changes.
Over the next few days, Ms. [**Known lastname 20741**] developed severe metabolic
acidosis with high lactate levels and an aspiration pneumonia
that required intubation and ICU admission. She was given
Levaquin with clearing of her pneumonia. Her lactic acidosis was
succesfully corrected with hyperventilation and fluids in the
next day. However, she failed extubation twice and on the [**8-17**] required placement of a tracheostomy tube. She also had a
PEG tube placed at that point. She then developed seizures that
were eventually controlled with Dilantin, Keppra, and Ativan.  At
this point she developed a second right lower lobe pneumonia. She
was initially treated with Clindamycin and Cipro. Due to her
decreased responsiveness with quadriplegia, a head MRI was
obtained on the [**8-24**] that showed wide spread bilateral
cortical hyperintensitis on FLAIR, DWI and T2WI consistent with
stroke- like lesions and remarkable subcortical atrophy with a
normal MRA. EMG was also obtained that showed diffused severe
myopathy possibly consistent with critical care myopathy. An
abdominal CT obtained around that time showed a right colon
impaction believed to be secondary to dysmotility from MELAS
syndrome. A general surgical consult believed that she was not a
good surgical candidate and had recommended that she become NPO
with NGD compression and TPN for nutrition.  Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] from the
neuro-muscular service was also consulted who reccomended a 5
day-course of high dose IV Prednisone. At the end of the 5 days
due to her lack of significant improvement, a family consult was
obtained that agreed on making the patient DNR/DNI, comfort
measures only and the antibiotics were stopped on the [**8-29**].
At this point she began to show clinical improvement and so was
reinstated to full code status on the [**8-2**]. TPN was
restarted and aggressive bowel regimen was begun to try to clear
her partial large bowel obstruction. On the [**8-3**] she
became febrile and was found to have coag negative staph
bacteremia. The right subclavian line she had in was stopped at
that point and she was started on Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone.
A chest x-ray on the [**8-8**] showed increasing
infiltrates in the right middle lobe and the left lung, so her
Ceftriaxone was changed to Zosyn.  As she was seizure free from
the [**7-31**] she was transferred to the Medicine Service
to manage her pneumonia and her partial large bowel obstruction.
After her transfer she remained afebrile and repeat blood
cultures were negative.  An infectious disease consult was
obtained that recommended five days of Vanco for her line sepsis
and fourteen days of Zosyn for her pneumonia. She did well on
both of these treatments. A GI consult was obtained with regard
to her partial large bowel obstruction and an aggressive bowel
regimen including Reglan, suppositories, enemas, Colace and
Golytely was recommended, which helped to clean out most of her
bowel.  By the time of this dictation her abdomen is soft and
only a single mass of stool is palpable in the suprapubic region.
She was on TPN for nutrition for most of [**Month (only) **] until the
[**8-17**] when her family decided they wished to
withdraw treatment and at that point her TPN was stopped.
From a neurological standpoint her Dilantin level was 26 on the
[**8-16**] and so it was held and will be restarted after
her level drops to the low 15.  She will continue on IV
Ativan for seizure prophylaxis.
On the [**8-18**] her neurological status has progressed
to the point where she is not responsive to voice except for
occasionally.  She has been afebrile for over a week and has
improved clinically in terms of her pneumonia with decreased
secretions on the Zosyn.  She will have three more days of Zosyn
and then be done with antibiotics.  Her NG tube and PEG tube are
clamped and she is receiving no more drugs for her bowel regimen.
She continues to receive trach care and suctioning with stable
amount of secretions.  Her antiepileptic drugs include Ativan and
Dilantin.  The Dilantin is being held and his being restarted
after the levels are less then 15.  She is in the midst of a
Solu-Medrol taper.  The only other medications that she is
receiving are heparin and Protonix for prophylactic purposes.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:

1.  End-stage MELAS with diffused multiple bilateral cortical
stroke-like lesions, a severe generalized myopathy and GI
dysmotility resulting in a partial large bowel obstruction.
2.  Resolving pneumonia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Ativan 0.5 mg IV t.i.d.  2.
Dilantin 300 mg IV q.h.s.  3.  Zosyn 4.5 mg q 8 hours times
three days.  Her Zosyn will end on the [**8-20**].
Solu-Medrol 10 mg IV q 8 hours being tapered.  5.  Heparin
5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d.  6.  Protonix 40 mg IV q.d.
7.  Tylenol prn.  8.  Ativan 0.25 to 0.5 mg q 6 hours prn for
facial twitching and arm trembling.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 72-year-old white male is
status post CABG in [**2164**] and recently presented to his
physician with PND and wheezing. He has had these symptoms
for 2 weeks. This has been associated with increasing fatigue
and dyspnea on exertion. He also has had worsening pedal
edema which he says is chronic. He was seen by his physician
and then evaluated in the emergency room for CHF and treated
with Lasix. He ruled out for a myocardial infarction but had
BNP of 810. He had an echocardiogram which revealed an EF of
35%, moderate MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], and mild AI,  with distal septal
dyskinesis, and moderate hypokinesis in the inferior lateral
region. He is transferred for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a history of
hypertension, coronary artery disease, status post CABG in
[**2164**] (with a saphenous vein graft to the RCA), and a history
of chronic lower extremity edema.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Propranolol 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Adalat 30 mg p.o. daily, aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily, and
Combivent inhaler.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married and lives with his wife. [**Name (NI) **]
drinks 3 beers a day and quit smoking 20 years ago.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  He is an elderly white
male in no apparent distress. Vital signs were stable,
afebrile. HEENT exam revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Extraocular movements were intact. The oropharynx was benign.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal. The neck was supple with full
range of motion. No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly. The
carotids were 2+ and equal bilaterally without bruits. The
lungs had bibasilar rales. Cardiac exam was regular in rate
and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic murmur and a positive S4. The
pulses were 1+ bilaterally throughout.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted and underwent cardiac
catheterization which revealed an occluded RCA, 90% stenosis
of saphenous vein graft, a complex LAD lesion at the
bifurcation of 90%, and a 70% left circumflex lesion, with an
EF of 35%.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted. He had carotid studies which
revealed a less than 40% bilateral stenosis. He was diuresed.
On [**4-29**] he underwent a redo CABG x 1 with a Mosaic MVR.
He had a LIMA to the diagonal, and he had a 29-mm Mosaic MVR.
His vessels were intramyocardial, and his other vessels were
unable to be bypassed. He was transferred the CSICU on
Levophed, epinephrine, and propofol. On his postoperative
night he had some hypotension but then was more stable by the
morning. He was transfused a unit of blood. He remained
intubated the first day to stabilize his blood pressure. His
epinephrine was discontinued on postoperative day #2. His
Levophed was gradually weaned off. He was extubated on
postoperative day #2. He required aggressive diuresis and
pulmonary therapy. He continued to slowly progress.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  He was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day #5. He had his wires discontinued on
postoperative day #6. He continued diuresis and physical
therapy. He was discharged to home in stable condition with

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 76-year-old woman admitted
to the hospital for elective hip surgery, open reduction and
internal fixation of the left hip, status post hip fracture
in [**2189-5-30**], coming again as an inpatient for elective
surgery for revision due to nonunion of the fracture.  The
patient had the surgery on [**3-1**], without any
complications, intraop blood loss of 900.

On postop day #2, the patient was noted to have altered
mental status per nursing and daughter.  The patient was not
responding to commands, and was not answering questions
appropriately, and did recognize family members.  The patient
also was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response rate in the 120s.  Given these two
conditions, the patient was transferred to the MICU service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Pertinent for hypertension; obesity;
status post pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome in [**2186**]; CVA x
2, first in [**2182**], a second in [**2183**], affecting the left side
with minimal permanent deficits; osteoarthritis; GERD, status
post intestinal bypass; as well as appendectomy; and
cholecystectomy, as well as a hernia repair; depression;
fibromyalgia; diabetes mellitus, baseline.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa with which she gets a rash.

OUTPATIENT MEDS:  Include atenolol 50 mg qd, perphenazine
37.5 mg po bid, and Tagamet, aspirin.

INITIAL EXAM:  The patient was not alert and oriented, was
not answering questions, or following commands.  Vitals -
97.6, heart rate 92-117, BP 156/70, respiratory rate 16,
satting 96% on room air.  In general, she was in no apparent
distress.  Oropharynx was clear.  Pupils equally round and
reactive to light.  Mucous membranes were dry.  No bruits on
neck.  Chest - anterior chest with coarse breath sounds.
Cardiology - irregularly, irregular, borderline tachycardic.
Abdomen was mildly distended, good bowel sounds, nontender.
Extremities - good distal pulses.  Neuro exam - again, not
alert and oriented, 1+ reflexes diffusely, good muscle tone,
unable to answer questions.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's hematocrit was 28.4, repeat
25.5, white blood cell count not elevated.  Chem-7 141,
sodium 4.7, potassium 110, chloride 22, bicarb 26, creatinine
1.4.  All three sets of cardiac enzymes were negative.  INR
1.3, PT 14, PTT 27.6.  ABG 7.34, carbon dioxide 40, and
oxygen 115.  UA was noted to have [**3-3**] white blood cells, with
occasional bacteria.  Urine culture showed no growth.  Hip
culture on [**3-2**] showed no growth to date.  Chest x-ray had
ventricular enlargement and possible early CHF.  EKG had
atrial fibrillation.

ISSUES - 1) MENTAL STATUS CHANGES:  Most likely secondary to
narcotic overuse.  The patient was given 3 tabs po percocet,
as well as 2 mg of IV dilaudid.  There was a question of
stroke versus subdural versus infection.  CT scan of the head
was negative.  The patient remained afebrile.  Urine culture
was negative.  Blood culture pending.  Again, the patient
responded very well during the hospital course in terms of
mental status changes resolved.  The patient, upon dispo, is
clear mentally, back to baseline.

2) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Blood pressure has been stable, but
because of a rapid ventricular response was given Lopressor
pushes, and then finally po atenolol to keep her heart rate
within normal limits.  The patient was on telemetry.  The
patient was started on anticoagulation of IV heparin, will be
D/C on Lovenox and then coumadin 4 mg until she is
therapeutic.

3) LOW HEMATOCRIT:  Likely secondary to blood loss, given the
900 blood loss.  Stool guaiac negative.  Post-transfusion,
her crit has been stable for 24 hours.

4) HIP FRACTURE:  She will continue Lovenox anticoagulation,
as well as continue physical therapy, going to [**Hospital **] Rehab.
She has a right subclavian in terms of access which will be
D/C.  She was full code, and we were in communications with
the daughter.

DISCHARGE MEDICATION:  Included Lovenox 40 mg subcu qd,
atenolol 50 mg po qd, perphenazine 37.5 mg po bid, Tylenol
650 mg po q 4-6 h.

 INDICATION:  Status post Whipple and right hepatectomy for metastatic duodenal
 carcinoma, surveillance study.

 COMPARISON:  Preoperative CT scan of [**2190-1-1**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
 before and after the administration of IV contrast at various phases.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is interval development
 of a moderate right-sided pleural effusion.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.

 Patient is now status post right hepatectomy and Whipple with hepatico- and
 pancreaticojejunostomies.  A stent appears to be present extending from the
 distal pancreatic duct into what appears to be the pancreaticojejunostomy
 connection.  There is small ascites with small peripancreatic fluid.  Arterial
 phase and portal venous phase images demonstrated perfusion abnormality
 diffusely throughout segment IV of the liver.  The main portal vein and main
 left portal vein and left lateral portal venous branches appear patent and
 well delineated.  Multiple portal venous branches to segment IV are also
 opacified although appear less well delineated compared to branches to the
 lateral segment and possibly diminished compared to the preoperative study of
 [**2190-1-1**].  The main hepatic, and main left hepatic arteries appear patent,
 as well as at least the proximal portions of the left hepatic artery
 bifurcation to the medial and lateral branches.  Delayed images demonstrate
 filling of the left hepatic vein as well as more uniform perfusion of segment
 IV.  Spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.  A percutaneous
 feeding tube is in place.  Multiple small retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen
 and not significantly changed.  Loops of small and large bowel are of grossly
 normal caliber.  There is stranding in the anterior abdomen, presumably
 postoperative in nature.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The bladder, right distal ureter, rectum,
 and sigmoid colon are grossly unremarkable.  The patient has a fibroid uterus.
 There is a right adnexal cyst.  There is pelvic free fluid.

 Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

History of Present Illness:
Dr. [**Known lastname 107769**] is a 57-year-old patient with a known adenocarcinoma
in the duodenum causing recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and
recurrent anemia. She has had exhaustive preoperative evaluation
which has demonstrated also the presence of a single metastasis
in the liver. For palliation, if not curative  ntent, I
recommended that she undergo a combined Whipple procedure to try
to get the primary tumor out to eliminate the bleeding and
impending obstruction of the duodenum. I also convened with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] of our hepatobiliary surgery team to consider resection of
the metastatic disease in the liver, as there is no other
evidence of systemic metastases.

Past Medical History:
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant only for known cyst in the
breast.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient went to the operating room on [**2190-1-5**]. Please see the
OMR note for operative details. There were no unanticipated
intra-operative complications, and the patient lost
approximately one liter of blood and received three units PRBCs
during the procedure. 2 19-French [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains were placed to
liver bed and pancreatic biliary anastomoses locations.
Post-operatively she went to the surgical ICU. Her pain was
controlled with epidural and PCA. On POD1 INR was 2.0 and the
patient received 2 units of FFP. POD1 liver US also demonstrated
normal spectral analysis and color Doppler evaluation of the
vasculature of the residual left hepatic lobe. On POD2 she
received another 2 units FFP for INR 1.9, and since
transaminases remained elevated another liver ultrasound.
Ultrasound was normal-""Again, seen are widely patent main and
left portal veins with appropriate direction of flow. The left
hepatic vein and hepatic artery are  also patent and  patency
and appropriate direction of flow. Again, the left hepatic
artery demonstrates a resistive index of 0.60. There is no
biliary ductal dilatation.  here is no free fluid. The inferior
vena cava is widely patent."" POD3 the G-tube was clamped and
half-strength J-tube feedings were begun. Patient was also
transferred out of the unit to the floor on POD3. TF were slowly
advanced and on POD4 she was advanced to sips as well as
transitioned to oral pain medications. Foley catheter was
removed from the bladder on POD5 and tube feeds were cycled at
night. Lasix was given on POD5 and the patient began to mobilize
significant fluid accumulation, especially in the lower
extremities. By POD5 she was also tolerating full liquids and
was doing well ambulating around the floor and working with
physical therapy. Her central line was removed on POD6 and she
was transitioned to all oral medications per the ""Whipple
Protocol"". Her electrolytes were aggressively repleted and
intermittent doses of lasix were helpful in gaining euvolemia.
She continued to have some trouble with nausea that was
controlled with antiemetics but was troublesome nonetheless. JP
drains were removed before discharge, and the patient was begun
on a 7 day course of cefazolin for a superficial cellulitis. She
was discharged to home with services on POD10. She was afebrile,
tolerating a full diet and ambulating without difficulty. Her
wounds were healing nicely and she was instructed on proper G
and J tube care. She has follow-up as outlined below.

 level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 153 mg/dL. The area
 imaged spanned the region from the skull base to the upper thighs.

 Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
 images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
 determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
 implications regarding the significance of that uptake.

 INTERPRETATION: There is no prior study.

 There is focal FDG uptake (SUV max 3.8) in the anterior right hepatic lobe where
 there is ill-defined low attenuation on the CT scan measuring 3.3 x 2.1 cm.
 There are several tiny lung nodules scattered throughout both lobes measuring up
 to 4 mm, which are not FDG-avid.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions,
 right greater than left.

 There is no suspicious lymphadenopathy in the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
 There is a biliary stent in place with air in the biliary system.  There is no
 evidence of biliary ductal dilatation.  There is mild emphysema.

 IMPRESSION: FDG-avid lesion in the right hepatic lobe, which could represent
 neoplasm or infection.  Further evaluation with contrast enhance CT or MRI may
 be helpful.

 Several sub-centimeter lung nodules, which are not FDG-avid but too small to
 reliably characterize with PET.  Follow-up with diagnostic CT may be obtained to
 establish radiologic stability.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
woman with a history of right upper extremity tremor.  She
had an MRI scan which showed a 7 mm right posterior
communicating artery fetal PCA aneurysm.  She was seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] and admitted for angio and possible coil embolization
of this aneurysm.  She was admitted status post arteriogram
which showed evidence of this right PCA aneurysm which was
not amenable to coiling; therefore, the patient was scheduled
for clipping of this aneurysm.  She remained in the hospital,
was seen by cardiology and cleared for surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Migraines, 2) Palpitations, 3)
Hepatitis A.

ALLERGIES:  1) codeine, 2) sulfa, 3) penicillin.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy as a
child.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was taken to the OR on [**2195-3-24**] for
clipping of this right fetal PCA aneurysm without intraop
complication.  Postop, the patient was in the Intensive Care
Unit.  She was extubated on postop day #1.  She was awake,
alert, oriented, following commands, moving all extremities
with no drift.  She was weaned to 2 liters nasal cannula.

She was ruled out for an MI per protocol per cardiology,
which she did rule out for.  Her vital signs remained stable.
She was afebrile, and she was transferred to the floor on
postop day #2.  She remained neurologically awake, alert,
oriented x 3 with a slight left drift on postop day #3.
Repeat head CT showed no new evidence of hemorrhaging or
stroke.  She had an upper extremity Doppler due to some left
upper extremity weakness and swelling which was also
negative.  She was seen by physical therapy and occupational
therapy and found to require rehab.  Her left upper extremity
weakness did improve greatly before discharge.  Her vital
signs remained stable.  Her incision was clean, dry and
intact.

 INDICATION:  Recent exploratory laparotomy/cholecystectomy/gastrostomy now
 with oozing wound.  Question dehiscence.

 TECHNIQUE:  After administration of oral and IV contrast, MDCT was used to
 obtain contiguous axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis.
 Comparison to [**2187-6-18**] study.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is minor atelectasis at both lung bases.
 No pleural or pericardial effusion is seen.  Within the gallbladder fossa,
 there is a collection of air, representing Surgicel per the operative note of
 [**2187-8-7**].  Slight intrahepatic biliary ductal prominence is noted.
 Spleen, right kidney, adrenals, are normal.  The left kidney has a 2.4 cm
 cyst, unchanged.

 Within the pancreas again seen is a pancreatic pseudocyst measuring 3.5 x 8.5
 cm, similar in appearance to the previous exam.  Oral contrast is seen in
 bowel loops; the stomach is slightly thickened, which may be due to
 inflammation.  Also seen is slight thickening of the right colon.  The splenic
 vein is not well visualized.  Stranding is seen in the expected location of
 the lesser sac.  This is no evidence of bowel duct dilatation.

 Evidence of anterior vertical midline scar is seen.  A few areas of defect are
 noted in the anterior abdominal wall, one superior anterior to the liver
 (series 2, image 16), measuring 4 mm; another more inferior anterior to the
 stomach measuring 6 mm (series 2, image 25); another more inferior in the
 abdomen measuring approximately 6 mm at the L2 vertebral body level (series 2,
 image 35).  Another is seen in the anterior pelvic wall measuring 5 mm just
 deep to the portion of frank anterior abdominal wall opening, measuring 10 mm.
 At this region of incisional opening, a small amount of gas is seen, however,
 there is no discrete fluid collection.  There is no free air.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Bladder is distended.  Uterus, adnexa, distal
 ureters, rectum and sigmoid, are normal.  There is no free fluid in the
 pelvis.  There is no lymphadenopathy.

 Bone windows show no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Small areas of subcentimeter-sized dehiscence of anterior abdominal wall.
 Vertical midline incision.

debilitated and went to a rehab facility for many weeks.  In
the meantime, I have seen her, and I followed her course from
the clinic.  She has had generally strong progression, but
has been unable to gain weight, and does not eat more than
soft solids, with limited amounts.  She claims of abdominal
pain when she eats, as well as regurgitation.  She, in
general, has a failure to thrive and general unwellness.  We
also knew that we would have to address her gallbladder and
its stone disease at some point in time.

US INTR-OP 60 MINS

Reason: PSEUDOCYST

INDICATION: Patient with complicated pancreatitis and pseudocyst
formation. For possible surgical cystgastrostomy.

TECHNIQUE: The patient has already had a laparotomy and a
gastrostomy performed. Using sterile technique, intraoperative
son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed using transgastric approach and also
from an intragastric position.

REPORT:

FINDINGS. A small amount of anterior fluid measuring about 10 mL
was seen. Corresponding to the pancreas' position, there is an
ill-defined, enlarged isoechogenic material likely representing
a phlegmon. No discrete fluid collection is seen elsewhere.

Using son[**Name (NI) 493**] visualization, the small anterior cyst was
aspirated. Further passes were obtained from the phlegmon also
under ultrasound guidance.

CONCLUSION:

No evidence of large pseudocyst corresponding to recent CT
images

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Chronic respiratory failure and morbid obesity.

 Comparison is made to previous study of 1 day earlier.

 The examination is quite limited due to rotation of the patient and asymmetric
 positioning.  This combined with AP technique and obese body habitus limits
 assessment of the cardiac size and pulmonary vascularity, but no definite
 congestive heart failure is observed allowing for this factor.  There is some
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, but it does appear obscured.  Of note,
 the shoulders are asymmetrically positioned which may in part account for the
 asymmetric positioning of the left hemidiaphragm.

 IMPRESSION:  Limited radiograph of the chest due to positioning and body
 habitus.  Apparent elevation of left hemidiaphragm may be positional, but
 repeat radiograph with improved positioning is suggested for more complete
 assessment.  Ideally, PA and lateral chest radiographs within the department
 would be most helpful.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: End-stage renal disease with poor dialysis flows. A right subclavian
 temporary hemodialysis catheter was recently converted to a tunneled line.

 PHYSICIANS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 2606**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 2718**], with Drs.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 63**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 325**], the attending radiologists, supervising the
 entire procedure.

 TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Initial fluoroscopic check of the in situ 28-cm 14.5
 French tunneled right subclavian hemodialysis catheter showed that it did not
 pinch off with changes in arm position and that the catheter tip was
 positioned at the right atrium-inferior vena cava (IVC) junction on
 fluoroscopic radiographs. Both lumens of the catheter flushed well with
 sterile saline, but did not aspirate well. Given the difficulties with
 aspiration and the history of poor dialysis, we elected to change the catheter
 for a shorter one, in order to exclude malfunction due to catheter malposition
 (suspicion of contact between catheter tip and IVC wall).

 Following written informed consent and standard sterile prep and drape of the
 right side of the neck and the in situ catheter, a 0.035-inch Amplatz
 guidewire was advanced through each lumen of the in situ catheter and
 positioned in the inferior vena cava using fluoroscopic guidance. The in situ
 catheter was removed and a new, 24-cm long (19-cm cuff-to-tip), double lumen,
 14.5 French hemodialysis catheter was placed over both wires through the
 existing skin tunnel. This was done using fluoroscopic guidance. The catheter
 cuff was positioned near the skin entry site portion of the tunnel. The
 catheter tip was positioned within the superior aspect of the right atrium.
 Final position was confirmed with a limited chest radiograph. The catheter was
 sutured in place with three 2-0 silk sutures. A transparent sterile dressing
 was applied. Both lumens flushed and aspirated well, were capped, and
 heplocked. The catheter may be used immediately.

 COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications.

 MEDICATIONS: Local anesthesia with 4 cc of 1% lidocaine.

CHIEF COMPLAINT/HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a
59 year old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy
who presented to an outside hospital with a history of
dyspnea on exertion times one week and bilateral lower
extremity edema.  The patient initially attributed these
symptoms to his asthma, however, when the symptoms continued
to worsen and he was short of breath at rest, he presented to
the hospital.  At that time he denied chest pain,
palpitations, sharp pain or any extremity pain.  Chest x-ray
at that time showed congestive heart failure.  He was given
Lasix with no change in his shortness of breath but a marked
decrease in his lower extremity edema.  Arterial blood gases
at that time was 7.45, 40, 56, with an AA gradient of 24.  An
echocardiogram and stress test were ordered at that time.
Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 19%.  Stress
test showed reversible inferior wall defect.  The patient was
then transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for
cardiac catheterization and further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for ischemic
cardiomyopathy, mitral regurgitation, mild to moderate aortic
stenosis, diabetes mellitus, and asthma.

ALLERGIES:  He states an allergy to Sulfa.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Glucophage 500 mg t.i.d., Slo-[**Hospital1 **]
no dose given, Ventolin nebulizer, Aspirin 81 mg a day, Lasix
intravenously at an outside hospital.  Coreg 3.125 mg and
Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, smokes times 40 years, recently
quit.  Works as a sales executive.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After admission to [**Hospital6 649**] the patient was brought to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory.  Please see the catheterization
results for full details.  In summary the catheterization
showed a cardiac output of 4.45 with an index of 2.2 and
wedge of 13.  PA is 38/21.  Coronaries showed left main with
a 70% lesion, left anterior descending with mild disease,
circumflex with no critical lesions and right coronary artery
with mid segment total occlusion with distal flow from the
left anterior descending.

Physical examination on admission - General, white man in no
acute distress, alert and oriented times three.  Pupils
equal, round and reactive to light.  Chest clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  Cardiovascular, distant
heartsounds, S1 and S2, abdomen soft with positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities, no edema, cyanosis or clubbing.

Laboratory data at the outside hospital showed the hemoglobin
A1c of 10.6, arterial blood gases 7.45, pCO2 39, pO2 55,
white count 5.8, hematocrit 42.9, platelets 387, sodium 137,
potassium 4.3, chloride 101, carbon dioxide 24, BUN 16,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 310.  Liver function tests were
normal.  Creatinine kinase and troponin were negative times
three.  Cholesterol 215.  HDL 82.  LDL 122.  The patient had
a Persantine Myoview which showed an estimated ejection
fraction of 19%, grossly dilated left ventricular with
multiple perfusion defects, septal and inferior lateral walls
with reversibility in the inferior and lateral wall.
Echocardiogram done showed an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%
with a dilated left ventricle and mitral regurgitation.

Given these results along with the patient's cardiac
catheterization, intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and
following catheterization the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service
was consulted.  The patient was seen and accepted for
coronary artery bypass grafting +/- mitral valve replacement.
On [**2-13**], the patient was brought to the Operating Room
where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times three
with mitral valve annuloplasty.  Please see operative report
for full details.  In summary, the patient had a coronary
artery bypass graft times three with left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft
to the posterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to
the diagonal and mitral valve annuloplasty with a #28 band.
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred from the
Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At
the time of transfer, the patient had an intra-aortic balloon
pump at 1:1, Propofol, Milrinone and Levophed infusing.  The
patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.  The
patient was kept sedated on the night of his surgery.  On the
morning of postoperative day #1 sedation was discontinued.
The patient was weaned from the ventilator and successfully
extubated.  He remained hemodynamically stable with the
assistance of the intra-aortic balloon pump as well as
Neo-Synephrine and Levophed drips.  The patient was also
started on Amiodarone for frequent premature atrial
contractions.  On postoperative day #2, the patient continued
to remain hemodynamically stable.  His intra-aortic balloon
pump was weaned and successfully removed.  Over the next
several days, the patient remained hemodynamically stable.
His pressors were weaned to off with the exception of his
Milrinone which continued to be weaned very slowly and on
postoperative day #5, was ultimately discontinued.  During
this time, gentle diuresis was begun.  Following the
discontinuation of Milrinone, the patient began to be more
vigorously diuresed and his ACE inhibitor was begun.  On
postoperative day #5 the patient doing well and it was
decided that he was stable and ready for transfer to the
floor for continued postoperative care in cardiac
rehabilitation.  At that time the Heart Failure Service was
asked to consult on the patient to add in the care of Mr.
[**Known lastname 46437**].  Over the next several days with the assistance of
the nursing staff and physical therapy the patient's activity
level was increased.  He continued to be diuresed.  His
medications were adjusted and he remained hemodynamically
stable, and on postoperative day #10 it was decided that the
patient was stable and ready to be discharged to home the
following morning.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  At the time of discharge the
patient's condition was stable.  His physical examination
revealed vital signs with temperature 97.6, heartrate 90,
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 110/70, respiratory rate 18 and
oxygen saturation 94% on room air.  Weight preoperatively was
78 kg, at discharge 78.1 kg.  Laboratory data revealed white
count 9.7, hematocrit 32.9, platelets 741, sodium 135,
potassium 4.2, chloride 98, carbon dioxide 28, BUN 11,
creatinine 0.7, glucose 183.  Neurological, alert and
oriented times three.  He moves all extremities and follows
commands.  Breathsounds are diminished in the left base but
otherwise clear to auscultation.  Heartsounds, regular rate
and rhythm, S1 and S2, sternum stable.  Incision with
Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities, warm and well perfused.  The right leg incision
with Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass grafting times three with left internal mammary artery
to the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the
diagonal.
2.  Mitral regurgitation status post mitral valve repair with
a #28 annuloplasty band.

                                 FINAL REPORT

 INDICATION:  S/P C3 through 5 fusion, assess alignment and hardware.

 AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF CERVICAL SPINE are compared with [**2132-8-7**].
 Today's AP view is centered relatively low, limiting  assessment of the c-
 spine on the AP view.

 Compared with [**2132-8-7**], there has been considerable interval change in the
 alignment of both the fixation hardware and C3/4 vertebral bodies. As before,
 the patient is s/p C3-5 fusion procedure, with 3 left-sided pedicle screws and
 2 right-sided pedicle screws, secured along bilateral vertical spinal rods.
 However, on today's exam, the superior-most pedicle screw (presumably on the
 left) is no longer superimposed over (i.e. fixed within) the C3 posterior
 elements. In addition, there has been interval progression of the degree of
 C3/4 anterolisthesis, from Grade II to Grade III. The C4 and C5 pedicle
 screws are unchanged, without evidence of loosening.

 Again seen is an approximately 1 cm  metallic fragment overlying C2
 posteriorly.  This is of unknown origin or etiology -- ? a portion of the
 right-sided spinal rod.  It is unchanged in position on the lateral view (seen
 only on the lateral view on taoday's exam, due to low centering on the AP
 view).

 At C3/4, posterior to the spinous processes, there is a  cerclage wire
 extending along the posterior elements and hardware in the midline.  This
 appears to be intact, but is included only at the periphery of the AP view.

 There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. There is relative  dilation of
 the supraglottic airway and piriform sinuses and there is an unusual obliqued
 alignment of the supraglottic airway on the AP view, raising the question of
 slight displacement of this portion of the airway to the left.

 Again seen are degenerative changes most pronounced at C5-7, with disc space
 narrowing and marginal osteophytes, unchanged.

 Also again seen are skin staples over the posterior neck, as well as sternal
 wires and clips, consistent with a prior CABG.

 IMPRESSION:

 1) The left-sided C3 screw is no longer afixed to the posterior elements of
 C3. This is associated with worsening anterolisthesis.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 34062**] was paged

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Endocarditis and spinal infection.

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal and axial T1 and T2-weighted images, post-contrast T1-
 weighted images and sagittal STIR images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:

 As seen on the somewhat limited study of [**2146-2-23**], there is edema involving the
 C3, C4, C5 and C6 vertebral bodies with surrounding epidural and paraspinal
 inflammatory changes, and enhancement of the C3/4, C4/C5 and C5/C6 disks,
 findings consistent with discitis and osteomyelitis.  There is some fluid in
 the C5/C6 disk, as seen previously.  The prior study showed posterior
 bilateral non-enhancing material contiguous with the disk, most consistent
 with an epidural abscess.  This appears to have markedly improved compared to
 the prior study.  There remains thick epidural enhancement at C4/C5, and
 C5/C6, with extension into the foramina at both levels.

 There is edematous enhancing soft tissue anterior to the affected vertebral
 bodies as well without evidence of paraspinal abscess.  There have been
 laminectomies at each of the levels between C3 and C7 and there is kyphosis,
 centered at C4, unchanged.  No spinal cord compression is seen.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The nonenhancing fluid in the anterior epidural space at the C5/C6 level,
 contiguous with the disk, has improved consistent with an improved epidural
 abscess.
 2.  The bone marrow and intervertebral disk abnormalities consistent with
 discitis osteomyelitis seen at the levels between C3 and C7 are otherwise
 approximately stable.
 3.  There have been laminectomies and removal of the spinous processes at
 those levels.  There is less fluid in the surgical defect.  No spinal cord
 compression is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] was transferred from an OSH on [**2146-1-30**].
He was initially evaluated by cardiology and neurology.  Head CT
and MRI rose question of epidural abscess and neuro-surgery was
consulted.  An infectious disease consult was also initiated
immediately with recommendation for ongoing gent and Pen G.
A C3-C6 epidural abscess was suspected with associated
meningitis and sepsis and he was taken emergently to the OR for
C3-C6 laminectomy on [**2146-1-31**].  Addional findings of ""weak bone""
associated with osteo but no findings of focal abscess.
The cardiac surgery team was consulted on [**2146-2-2**].  TEE on [**2146-2-2**]
supported diagnosis or endocarditis.  Over the next several
days, Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] went through a pre-operative evaluation and was
followed by neurology, neuro surgery, and infectious disease.
He continued to be in the ICU, intubated, and confused/agitated.
 It was felt that he was not ready for surgery and that the
longer antibiotics could be continued prior to surgery the
better Mr. [**Known lastname 58889**] outcomes would be.  He was also treated for
pneumonia.
He was successfully extubated on [**2146-2-7**] and remianed extubated
through [**2-11**] however he remained in the ICU for hemodynamic
monitoring.
Ongoing CHF with inability to obtain optimal hemodynamics pushed
Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] to surgery emergently on [**2-14**].
On [**2146-2-14**] he proceeded to the OR with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] and
underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 25 mm perimount
pericardial valve.  Please see OR report for full details.
On POD 1, Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] failed to [**Doctor Last Name **] from the ventilator.
Infectious disease continued to follow Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] with ongoing
recs for vancomycin and levofloxacin.
On POD 2 he was succcessfully weened and extubated.  ID
discontinued his fluconazole.  He continued with an altered
mental status.
POD 3 through 7 he continued with hemodynamic monitoring and abx
administration.  He continued to be confused in the ICU.
A neuro consult on POD 7 stated significantly improved mental
status.  He was continued on haldol but began to [**Doctor Last Name **] from it.
On POD 9 he was transferred to the inpatinet floor for ongoing
recovery and rehabilitation.  His haldol was weened over the
next three days with ongoing dosing only at bedtime with
significant clearing of mental status to.  Neuro surgery was
again consulted to eval need for ongoing use of cervical collar
that Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] had been wearing since his laminectomy and it
was decided that he did not need to continue wearing it.
On POD 10 he was noted to have a worsening heart murmur and TTE
was obtained showing a ventricular septal defect.  Further
evaluation of this VSD (as a TEE) was declined as no surgical
intervention was felt to be necessary.
He continued with physical therapy through POD 15 and it was
felt that Mr. [**Known lastname 38829**] would benefit greatly from rehabilitation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50 year old
right-handed Armenian man with a history of a left middle
cerebral artery stroke in [**2150-5-29**] as well as a history of
one prior seizure in [**2151-9-28**] while taking Aricept and
Wellbutrin.  The patient has no history of seizures prior to
his stroke.  His prior seizure occurred in the shower.  His
family heard him cry out and fall and when they opened the
door he was awake but slightly confused.  He, at that time,
had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of
epileptiform activity.  It did show some left temporal
slowing with drowsiness.  He was not started on any
antiepileptic medication at that time.  He has been in his
usual state of health recently.  He denies any fevers,
chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, new weakness.  He
has a mild residual right hemiparesis, his arm more than leg
at baseline.  He was recently increased several days prior to
presentation on a dose of Reminyl which was tripled.
However, otherwise he has had no new medications.  On the day
of admission, his mother-in-law found him sitting on the
couch, slumped to one side, unresponsive possibly, shaking
all four extremities.  There was no report of any focal
activity.  The patient reportedly stopped shaking in two to
three minutes.  The family called 911.  The patient was still
somewhat unresponsive.  He began to vomit enroute to the
Emergency Room and was intubated.  At [**Hospital6 649**] Emergency Room he had a head computerized
tomography scan which just showed evidence of an old left
frontotemporal infarct with encephalomalacia but no evidence
of acute infarct.  He was loaded with Dilantin in the
Emergency Room and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for
ventilator management.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is from [**Country 9362**] originally.  He
has lived in the United States for 11 years.  He apparently
used to know English, however, after his stroke he forgot
English and now only speaks Russian.  He used to work as a
gymnastics coach as well as used to drive a cab.  He is no
longer working after his stroke.  He lives with his wife who
speaks English well.  He has one son, age 23 and one daughter
age 16.  [**Name2 (NI) **] used to be a heavy smoker and quit for one and
half years after his stroke, however, he recently restarted.
His mother-in-law still lives with the family.  He only
drinks alcohol at special occasions.

FAMILY HISTORY:  There is no history of seizures or stroke.
His father died at age 84 from coronary artery disease.  His
mother died from stomach cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At time of the transfer to the floor,
his temperature was 98.8, blood pressure was 100/55, pulse
91.  He was breathing at 23, sating 100% on blow-by oxygen.
He was extubated, awake but sleepy with an nasogastric tube
in place, normocephalic, atraumatic with dry mucous
membranes.  Lungs were slightly coarse at the bases.  Cardiac
examination was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs
or gallops appreciated.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities
revealed no edema.

Mental status examination:  He would speak only in Russian
through a translator.  He was able to state his age, state
that he was in the hospital.  He would follow commands
somewhat although he was somewhat uncooperative and had some
poor understanding of what was asked of him.  His wife
reported that his speech was not dysarthric in Russian.
Cranial nerve examination revealed pupils were 4 mm to 2 mm,
round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements were
full. He initially very poorly cooperative to visual field
testing but blinks to threat on both eyes.  He initially
would not smile but had no obvious facial asymmetry.  On
motor examination, left arm and leg had full strength.  He
cooperated poorly initially with examination on the right
side, but on re-examination was found to have 4+/5 right
finger extensors and right triceps.  His right lower
extremity was full strength.  Sensation was intact to light
touch throughout.  Coordination initially was uncooperative
but later finger-nose-finger testing revealed no evidence of
dysmetria.  Reflexes were 3+ in the right upper extremity and
2+ in the left upper extremity, he had 3+ reflexes at both
patella bilaterally and his plantar response was flexor
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  At the time of admission his white count
was 17.9, hematocrit of 37.5, platelets 201, INR 1.0, sodium
140, potassium 4.1, BUN 10, creatinine 1.0.  His creatinine
kinase was 62, troponin less than 0.3.  He had a urinalysis
which showed no evidence of infection.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 50 year old right-handed
Armenian male with a history of a prior left middle cerebral
artery infarct as well as a history of one prior seizure in
[**2151-9-28**].  He was admitted with a recurrent seizure in
the setting of recently increased Reminyl dose.  The patient
likely aspirated during his initial vomiting in the
ambulance.  He was extubated successfully but continued to
have low grade fevers and a mild cough.  He had blood
cultures unremarkable.  His chest x-ray showed evidence of
bibasilar atelectasis versus  infiltrates.  He was started on
antibiotics and defervesced.  He was also continued on
Dilantin.  His mental status improved significantly over the
first several days.  He also had an magnetic resonance
imaging scan of the head which showed no evidence of acute
infarct and evidence of an old left middle cerebral artery
infarct.  The patient began to eat and had no other
complications and is to be discharged to home.  He was
instructed on not driving for six months, no standing in high
places, no swimming alone, no bathing and he will follow up
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2152-3-7**].

History of Present Illness:
This is a 50 year old male with history of hypertension,
osteomyelitis, chronic pain and depression who was brought in
from home after an attempted suicide by narcotic overdose. Per
patient's wife, she heard a thud in the other room and found the
patient ""jerking"" on the ground. EMS was called and found the
patient to be in cardiac arrest, administered epinephrine with
return of sinus rhythm (no shock given) and subsequently
intubated the patient for airway protection. Patient was found
with an empty bottle of dilaudid. Patient takes methadone and
dilaudid for chronic ankle pain. [**Name (NI) **] wife noted that he
had been very depressed and crying at times over the past few
months.
.
In the ED, vitals 101.8, 110, 75/20, 19, 99%. Toxicology screen
was positive for methadone/opiates and ETOH (level 88),
otherwise negative for aspirin and tylenol. Stat head CT was
negative for bleed or emboli. Chest x-ray showed no acute
infiltrate. EKG showed sinus tach with 1/2mm ST depressions in
V3-V4. Patient's initial lactate 27 and he was given 3 amps of
HCO3 with repeat lactate 10. Patient's initial ABG
6.65/91/348-bicarb 12. Repeat ABG
7.11/44/142/15.
.
Toxicology was consulted. Patient admitted to taking double his
usual methadone dose, but denied ASA, tylenol or other agents.
Toxicology did not fell that patient's presentation was
consistent with narcotic overdose as patient improved without
narcan.
.
Patient was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl. He
was bolused 4 liters normal saline. Three PIVs were placed and
Levophed was started peripherally. Patient's SBP increased to
SBO 100s and levaphed was weaned. Patient's levophed stopped
prior to transfer to the MICU.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI:
IMPRESSION: Signal abnormalities at both posterior frontal and
parietal convexity region on FLAIR and T2-weighted images
without corresponding enhancement or diffusion abnormalities.
These findings could be secondary to previous infarcts. No
enhancing lesions are seen. If the patient has prior MRI
examinations, comparison would be helpful. The appearances are
not typical for reversible encephalopathy. Small areas of
microhemorrhages are seen in both cerebral hemispheres near the
convexity indicating old hemorrhages. No enhancing lesions are
seen.
MRA OF THE HEAD: Normal MRA OF THE HEAD:
MRV OF THE HEAD: Normal MRV of the head.
.
DUPLEX LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US [**2-25**]:
1. Normal Doppler study.
2. Extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with mild intrahepatic
biliary ductal dilatation. An MRCP would be helpful in order to
assess for any obstructive process.
3. Marked wall thickening of the gallbladder with intramural
edema. This can be seen in several clinical scenarios, including
cholecystitis but other features of cholecystitis are not
present such as stones and distention. If however this diagnosis
is strongly suspected clinically a HIDA scan could be performed.
The appearance can be seen in acute hepatic disease and
hypoalbuminemia as well.
4. Possible edema around the head of the pancreas. Correlation
with pancreatitic enzymes to exclude coincident pancreatitis is
recommended.
.
EEG [**2-25**]:
BACKGROUND: Consisted of a 10 Hz posterior predominant rhythm
bilaterally. At times, faster beta rhythms were observed. This
may be
due to medications.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed as the patient could
not
comply.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be done as this was a

portable EEG.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness into drowsiness
but no
stage II sleep was seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rate and rhythm with
a rate
of approximately 70 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is a normal EEG in the awake and drowsy states.
No
focal or epileptiform features were observed.
.
ECHO [**2-25**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2135-5-4**], there is less tricuspid regurgitation,
pulmonary pressures are lower
.
MRI ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2136-2-26**]:
1. Underdistended gallbladder with no apparent stones.
Gallbladder wall edema/pericholecystic fluid is not a specific
finding. If clinical concern exists for chronic cholecystitis, a
HIDA scan would be the study of choice.
2. Prominent extrahepatic bile duct tapers normally and
demonstrates no evidence of choledocholithiasis.
3. Extensive subcutaneous edema.
4. Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions.
Of note, technical issues prevented complete normal study and no
gadolinium was administered.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2136-2-28**]: PA and lateral radiographs of the
chest are reviewed, and compared with the previous study of
[**2136-2-25**].
The patient has been extubated. The previously identified
congestive heart failure has been improving. There is continued
cardiomegaly and small right pleural effusion associated with
bilateral lower lobe patchy atelectasis.
Note is made of a question of nodular opacity in the right apex,
which can be composite shadow. When patient is better, evaluate
with repeated PA, bilateral shallow oblique radiographs of the
chest.
IMPRESSION:
1. Improving congestive heart failure with remaining
cardiomegaly and small right pleural effusion.
2. Question of nodular opacity in the right apex.
.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT  [**2136-2-29**]: DVT within one of the
distal right brachial veins as well as cephalic vein. Basilic
vein was not visualized. No evidence of hematoma within the
right upper neck.
.
C1894 INT.SHTH NOT/GUID,EP,NONLASER  [**2136-3-1**]: Successful
placement of a 14-French 20-cm double-lumen hemodialysis
catheter by way of the left internal jugular vein with tip in
the superior vena cava. The catheter can be used immediately.
.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2136-3-2**]: No evidence of DVT in
the right lower extremity.
.
[**Numeric Identifier 7670**] FLUORO 1 HR W/RADIOLOGIST  [**2136-3-8**]: Successful conversion
from a temporary left internal jugular to a tunneled
hemodialysis catheter (27 cm from cuff to tip). The catheter is
ready for immediate use.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 50 year old man with history of hypertension,
depression, chronic pain and osteomyelitis who presented with
likely cardiac arrest secondary to opioid overdose and possible
associated seizure. On admission to the emergency department,
patient was only briefly hypotensive with systolic in 70's which
responded to IV fluid resuscitation and required transient
peripheral levophed. Patient was also empirically started on
broad spectrum antibiotics and given PO charcoal. A LP was
performed to rule out meningitis in setting of witnessed
seizure. Also, of note, patient was in severe lactic acidosis
with pH <7.0 which responded to stat administration of 3 amps of
sodium bicarbonate. Patient's mental status improved after ED
resuscitation and he was transferred to the MICU for further
care.
.
In the MICU, patient subsequently developed elevated LFTs,
rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. Patient remained
intubated for airway protection. Initially, patient had a severe
anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory
acidosis. Metabolic acidosis was likely secondary to lactic
acidosis in setting of cardiac arrest decreased organ perfusion
and possible seizure. Etiology of non-gap acidosis was unclear.
Patient's mental status and respiratory acidosis improved and he
was extubated on [**2-26**] after a RSBI ~10. Patient sating 94% on 5L
nasal cannula after extubation. Repeat CXR was improved but
continued to show pulmonary edema. Patient remained stable and
was subsequently transferred to the floor.
.
#. ?Seizure: Patient was initially worked up for seizure with a
differential diagnosis of opiate overdose, vasovagal induced,
infection induced or EtOH withdrawal induced. MRI/MRA/MRV were
negative for emboli or other abnormalities. Repeat ECHO this
admission largely unchanged from prior if not improved. LP was
performed and not consistent with meningitis. Patient with
positive tox screen for alcohol and opiates. Patient admitted to
drinking cough syrup at home. He and his wife had quit drinking
alcohol approximately 1 month ago. Patient was placed on CIWA
scale while on the floor. Unclear whether patient actually
seized or had post cardiac arrest movements however if patient
did seize the likely etiology was either alcohol withdrawal or
opiate overdose induced metabolic derangement. Patient's mental
status returned to baseline and no recurrence of seizures
occurred while in hospital. EEG was negative for seizure.
Nonspecific vascular findings on MRI, per neurology were old and
would not have contributed to current presentation. Plan is to
have patient follow-up with a repeat MRI and see neurology as an
outpatient in [**6-21**] weeks time.
.
#. Rhabdomyolysis: Etiology likely secondary to immobilization
and ischemic compression of muscle induced by opioid overdose
versus drug induced seizures or hyperthermia associated with
excess muscle energy demands. Also, metabolic derangement
including hypokalemia (2.8 on admission) and hypocalcemia (5.9)
may have contributed or caused the rhabdo but unclear etiology
of electrolyte abnormalities ?opioid overdose. CPK peaked at
150,000 on [**2-25**] and then continued to downtrend. Calcium was
repleted aggressively while alkalinizing his urine to prevent
further renal damage.
.
#. ARF: On admission, Cr 1.0 increaed to 4.8 on [**2-26**] and
continued to increase to peak of 10.3 on [**3-1**]. Etiology of acute
renal failure likely secondary to hypovolemia during cardiac
arrest and rhabdomyolysis. Patient was intially aggressively
hydrated and his urine was alkalinized with HCO3 to avoid
further renal damage from myoglobin. He was also given mannitol
to osmotically diurese which was eventually held on [**2-26**]. There
was an unsuccessful RIJ line placement on [**2-29**], no hematoma was
seen on neck US. IR placed temporary dialysis catheter in LIJ on
[**3-1**] and then switched over a tunnelled cath into LIJ on [**3-8**].
Patient initally required daily dialysis and then three times a
week. At time of discharge, patient had gone for 5 days without
dialysis and was making large volumes of urine. Electrolytes
were followed carefully and phosphate binders were used as
needed. He will need to have his electrolytes (Chem 7, calcium,
magnesium, phosphate) checked in 48 hours, 1 week, and two weeks
to ensure recovery of kidney function. He will need removal of
his tunneled hemodialysis catheter in two days, on [**2136-3-14**], to be done by interventional radiology. A renal consult
should be obtained for follow up of chemistries. The renal
consult service will decide when patient will be able to have
his tunneled catheter removed by interventional radiology.
.
#. Chronic pain/R LE pain: Patient with history of right ankle
injury requiring multiple surgeries between [**2126**]-[**2130**]. It was
recommended in [**2130**] that he have his R ankle amputated however
patient decided not to have the amputation and to medically
treat his chronic pain. Had been on methadone and dilaudid PO as
an outpatient. Pain medications were held until patient's mental
status was at baseline and then he was started and gradually
titrated up on a fentanyl patch with oxycodone PRN for
breakthrough. IV diladudid was used as breakthrough which was
subsequently switched to PO dilaudid and then discontinued due
to adequate pain control. Please obtain pain management consult
for pain control if pain is unable to be controlled with
fentanyl patch with oxycodone.
.
#. Depression: Patient now at baseline mental status however
severely depressed. Psychiatry was consulted regarding the
opiate overdose and felt that patient required inpatient
admission for suicide attempt. Continued to hold Zoloft.
Continued 1:1 sitter. As patient was medically stable, he was
transferred to an inpatient psychiatry floor for further care.
.
#. Anemia: Unclear etiology. Hct baseline 29.0. Paitnet received
2 units in hemodialysis on [**3-5**]. Hct remained stable thereafter.
Guaiaced all stools which have been negative.
.
#. R UE brachial DVT: Patient received anti-coagulation for 1
week with IV heparin and then for a short period of time on
coumadin. Review of US with radiology showed distal location of
possible clot and low risk for embolization and so no further
anti-coagulation was planned. Decision not to anticoagulate was
approved by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient will not need to have heparin SC
injections for DVT prophylaxis if he continues to ambulate.
.
#. Increased LFTs: most likely secondary to acidemia, possibly
shock liver. Initially, RUQ US suggestive for cholecystitis
however subsequent abdominal MRI showed prominent extrahepatic
bile duct tapers normally and demonstrates no evidence of
choledocholithiasis. Liver was consulted and recommended the
following tests: VZV IgG negative, CMV negative, ceruloplasmin
wnl, Hep A, B, C negative, [**Doctor First Name **] and anti-smooth Ab negative, IgG
low, HSV1 IgG-, HSV2 IgG-, EBV IgG+ IgM-. Alkaline phosphatase
and total bilirubin began to downtrend without intervention and
so no HIDA/MRCP was pursued. Near resolution of elevated LFTs at
time of discharge.
.
#. ID: Patient with very high temp in ED. Differential diagnosis
included seizure versus infectious etiology. Patient was
pan-cultured in ED with no growth. Patient was only briefly
hypotensive and on transient levophed. Patient initially
empirically covered with vanco, levo and flagyl. LP negative for
organisms and not consistent with meningitis. On [**2-26**],
antibiotics were discontinued given low suspicion for infection.
.
#. HTN: Continued to hold BP agents and follow SBP closely.
.
#. Obstructive sleep apnea: Unclear whether patient suffers from
this but he can schedule a sleep study as outpatient.
.
#. Abnormal chest x-ray findings: Patient will need to follow-up
with chest x-ray with PA/LAT/bilateral shallow oblique views to
re-evaluated possible nodular opacity in right apex of lung seen
on chest x-ray [**2136-2-28**]. However this admission, no definite
opacity in right apex of lung was seen in subsequent chest
x-rays. Patient has a remote history of pulmonary nodules of
unclear etiology. He would likely benefit from repeat imaging.

were stable. The patient did well postoperatively. The
patient was extubated on postop day 2. A liver duplex
[**Last Name (STitle) 950**] on postoperative day 1 was normal. The patient was
started on Prograf on postoperative day 1. The patient
received induction immunosuppression intraoperatively. This
consisted of 500 mg of Solu-Medrol, 1 gram of IV CellCept. On
postoperative day 1, hematocrit was 26.9 with a platelet
count of 85,000. The patient was transfused with 3 bags of
packed red blood cells, 5 bags of FFP and 3 bags of
platelets. Urine output was excellent with a creatinine of
0.8. LFTs postoperatively, AST was 2916, ALT 1069 and
alkaline phosphatase 94 with a total bilirubin of 9.2. The

platelets were lower at 68,000. Heparin antibody was sent
off. This was subsequently detected as positive. The patient
underwent a line change on postoperative day 4, a nonheparin
coated line. Chest x-ray confirmed placement. There was no
CHF or pneumonia noted at that time. The patient's diet was
advanced slowly. Abdomen remained soft with 2 J-Ps. Medial J-
P was removed on postoperative day 5 as well as the lateral J-
P for 35 and 55 cc, respectively.

Throughout the hospital course, the patient's blood sugars
fluctuated according to the Solu-Medrol taper. [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted. Sliding scale insulin was used to treat the high
or elevated glucoses. Pain was managed with IV Dilaudid with
good results. Breath sounds remained diminished at the bases
with O2 saturations in the mid 90s on 2 liters nasal cannula.
On postoperative day 4, IV medications were switched to p.o.
medications. The patient was ambulatory and doing well.
Physical therapy was consulted for assessment. The patient
was passing flatus and tolerating a regular diet, voiding
large amounts of yellow urine. Lasix was started on
postoperative day 4. The patient's weight had increased 10
kilograms. The patient slowly began to diurese throughout the

with supervision. The patient received PT daily until
discharge for pulmonary care, gait and balance, and stair
negotiation. Throughout this hospital course, the patient
remained on IV CellCept 1 gram twice a day. Solu-Medrol was
tapered down over the course of 10 days to a dose of 20 mg
p.o. daily. Prograf was adjusted to levels. On postoperative
day 4, Prograf level had increased to 17.9. Prograf was
decreased to 2 mg twice a day and subsequently increased when
Prograf level dropped down to 5.3 on postoperative day 7. The
patient received another chest x-ray on hospital day 7. No
CHF or pneumonia was noted. A repeat chest x-ray was again
done on postoperative day 8. This was negative as well.
Breath sounds were diminished on the left side. Albuterol

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 76-year-old male with a
history of MI with systolic dysfunction, EF less than 20%,
hyperlipidemia, AFib, and chronic renal insufficiency, who is
seen in Advanced Heart Failure Clinic and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for
nesiritide tailored therapy.  Patient had gone to [**State 108**] for the
winter in decompensated heart failure with recurrent atrial
fibrillation. Despite promising to seek medical care, he had not
sought cardiology followup in [**State 108**], while decompensating
further.  Patient went up 30 pounds in weight in [**State 108**].
Creatinine was found to be worsening.  Patient walks 10 yards and
is short of breath.

Patient was on admission not on an aspirin or beta-blocker.
Complains of moderate-to-low sodium diet.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1. Amiodarone 200 mg q.d.
2. Folic acid 1 mg q.d.
3. Atorvastatin 10 mg q.d.
4. Coumadin.
5. Furosemide 80 mg q.d.
6. Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.
7. Started nesiritide

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. CHF:  Systolic EF of less than 20%.
2. Coronary artery disease status post MI in [**2176**].
3. AFib status post on Coumadin.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. Hypothyroid.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient dates the owner of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1785**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in
[**Location 1268**].  History of smoking.  No alcohol use recently.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 96.3, blood pressure 90/62, heart
rate 76, respiratory rate 18, and 95% on room air.  Weight
70.6 kg.  Lungs with decreased breath sounds at the right
base half the way up the left base, but not as pronounced,
diffuse crackles.  Irregularly, irregular S1, S2 normal, no
murmur.  Abdomen:  Markedly distended and firm, nontender,
positive bowel sounds, positive fluid wave.  No lower
extremity edema.  Mild non-pitting edema on the left, mild
non-pitting edema on the right.  2+ pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORIES:  Creatinine found to be 3.6 on admission,
hematocrit 33.4.  LFTs unremarkable.  TSH greater than 100.

Chest x-ray showed heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CHF:  The patient was markedly decompensated and up
approximately 30 pounds.  Patient was on Natrecor 0.15, Lasix
drip of 7, and dopamine of 3 mcg to maintain pressure and
kidney perfusion.  Patient had a PICC line placed for these
medications.  Patient was still having difficulty diuresing
and his weight was still around 70 kg at this time.

2. Anemia:  The patient's hematocrit had been stable at
approximately around 33.

3. Ascites:  Plans were to do a paracentesis.  The Coumadin
was discontinued and the INR  allowed to drift down.  This
was going slowly so vitamin K 5 mg subq was given.

4. Coronary artery disease:  We continued his aspirin,
atorvastatin.  The beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor were not
started because he was in such decompensated heart failure
and was so hypotensive.

5. Hyperlipidemia:  We increased his Lipitor to 80 mg q.d.

6. Hypothyroid:  TSH was greater than 100 most likely from
amiodarone toxicity.  We restarted the patient on low-dose
levothyroxine at 25 mcg so that as not to cause any ischemia
to the patient.

7. Atrial fibrillation:  We discontinued the amiodarone
because of thyroid dysfunction, the patient not staying in
sinus rhythm.  We discontinued the Coumadin because of the
hopes of paracentesis next week.  Spoke with the attending
and there was no reason to place the patient on Heparin for
anticoagulation.

8. Chronic renal insufficiency:  Baseline creatinine 1.2-1.7
has been slowly decreasing from 3.6-3.0.  It has not gone
back towards baseline.

9. Full code:  I spoke with the patient and his girlfriend,
who wishes to be his healthcare proxy.  They wish all
measures to be performed.

10. Diet:  He was on a 2-gram sodium diet and restricted to 1
liter of fluid per day.  Electrolytes were repleted as
needed.

The rest of this discharge summary will be dictated at the
time of discharge.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
 HISTORY: History of heroin overdose with rabdomyolysis and persistent left
 lower extremity weakness and pain, evaluate left sciatic notch for nerve
 compression.

 TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar imaging was performed through the sacrum and posterior
 pelvis, according to the sacral plexus protocol. To better evaluate the left
 gluteal abnormality an attempt was made to perform more imaging of that
 region, but the patient refused to continue so the study was terminated.
 Comparison is made to prior CT and ultrasound of [**2192-8-5**] and prior lumbar
 spine MRI of [**2192-8-3**].

 FINDINGS: The sacral nerve roots appear normal bilaterally and there are no
 masses or fluid collections along their courses. However, note is again made
 of asymmetry of the piriformus muscles, left greater than right. However, this
 asymmetry is less than seen on the prior CT of [**2192-8-5**]. The left piriformus
 muscle does contain abnormal high T2 signal diffusely, as do all of the
 visualized portions of the gluteus minimus, medius, and maximus muscles on the
 left. There is no abnormal T1 signal in these muscles to suggest hemorrhage or
 atrophy.

 Again seen within the left gluteus medius muscle is an ovoid mass-like lesion
 measuring 4.5 x 6.6 cm. It is difficult to compare the size with the prior
 studies as this was not well seen on the prior CT and was only partially
 imaged in a different plane on the prior lumbar spine MRI. This lesion is
 primarily of low T2 signal and intermediate T1 signal. Note is made of several
 prominent linear signal voids wrapping around this lesion, consistent with
 dilated arterial branches.

 There are no bone marrow signal abnormalities. The visualized portion of the
 lumbosacral spinal canal appears unremarkable. Sacroiliac joints are normal.
 Limited assessmentof pelvic viscera are unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:

 1. Persistent edema/swelling of left piriformus and gluteus minimus, medius
 and maximus muscles. This may be mildly improved, as the piriformus muscle
 does not appear as large as it did on the CT of [**2192-8-5**].

 2. Persistent mass-like lesion in left gluteus medius muscle. This most likely
 represents an area of myonecrosis with fibrosis, likely related to the
                                                             (Over)

 consistent with an abscess.

 3.  F/U MRI in [**12-25**] months  to confirm resolution of the left gluteal mass
 lesion is recommended.

Date of Birth:   [**2168-11-24**]     Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital1 248**]

Patient remained in the hospital from [**8-11**] through
the 25th.  Since [**8-11**], the patient has had
intermittent low-grade fevers from 99 to 100.5 with
persistent tachycardia and hypertension following the
discontinuation of clonidine.  The heart rate and blood
pressure were unresponsive IV fluid boluses.

The etiology of the tachycardia and hypertension in the
setting of low-grade fevers was felt likely to be
multifactorial including clonidine withdrawal, poorly
controlled pain, and infection.  The patient continued to
report poorly controlled left lower extremity pain while
taking Neurontin and oxycodone prn.

Ultram 50 mg q4-6 hours prn was added for breakthrough pain
with modest relief.  Repeat chest x-ray and urinalysis were
unremarkable for signs of infection.  However, stool studies
from [**8-13**] were notable for Clostridium difficile
toxin.  The patient was started on a 10 day course of oral
Flagyl for Clostridium difficile colitis.

With improved pain control and time off of clonidine, the
patient's blood pressure and heart rate curve trended
downward.  It is felt that the treatment of the Clostridium
difficile colitis will also contribute to normalize the
patient's hemodynamics.  The patient continued to work with
Occupational and Physical Therapy with progress in activities
of daily living and weightbearing exercises.

The patient's acute renal failure continued to resolve with
persistently adequate urine output and continued decrease in
the creatinine level to within the normal range.  At this
point, the patient is considered medically clear for transfer
to an acute rehabilitation center for further intense work on
his left lower extremity weakness and occupational therapy
needs.

The patient will be scheduled for followup with [**Hospital 2996**]
Clinic in [**1-23**] weeks postdischarge.

                                 FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
 INDICATION:  The patient had a GJ tube.  The J-tube part of it was removed
 accidentally.  The patient needs a new GJ tube.  ALS and respiratory failure.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 117**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5089**], and Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 1413**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1413**], the attending radiologist, was present during the entire
 procedure and supervising.

 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed
 with the patient and informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought
 to the angiography suite and placed in supine position.  A scout view was
 obtained and demonstrates a G-tube with the tip in the stomach.  Approximately
 5 cc of contrast were injected through the G-tube to confirm the position
 within the stomach.  Using a Kumpi catheter a 0.024 super stiff Glidewire was
 advanced through the pylorus into the proximal jejunum.  The wire was then
 exchanged for an Amplatz wire.  Over the Amplatz wire, the old G tube was
 removed.  A new 45 cm 16 French MIC tube was then introduced over the wire and
 advanced into the proximal jejunum.  The balloon was inflated.  Contrast was
 injected into both ports and confirmed the correct placement of the distal
 port into the jejunum and the proximal part into the stomach.  The patient
 tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.

 MEDICATIONS:  Approximately 10 cc of 1% lidocaine were used.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a 45 cm MIC GJ tube with the tip in the
 jejunum.  The tube is ready for use.

There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small partially echo-filled inferolateral pericardial effusion
without evidence for tamponade physiology.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 70yo F with ALS and RA who presented with difficulty
clearing secretions and coughing. Given her known ALS, previous
hx of aspiration PNA, and elevated WBC count, this is most
likely was a repeat aspiration event.
.
1. Secretions/coughing: Likely aspiration PNA as above. As the
pt is on chronic prednisone 3mg daily for RA, she was given
stress dose steroids in the ED. These were switched to oral
prednisone and she was tapered back to her baseline 3 mg daily
during this admission.  She was treated with
levofloxacin/metronidazole 10 day course.  Received nebulizer tx
c albuterol/atrovent.  Underwent intermittent chest PT with good
effect.  Had sputum gram stain near d/c ([**2104-5-18**]) with + gs for
coag + staph; no fevers, no cough.  Likely colonizer;
sensitivities pending.  Please follow-up on speciation and
sensitivities.
.
2. ALS: The pt was diagnosed in [**2103-5-30**] and progression of ALS
is most likely contributing to her repeated aspiration PNA.
Underwent placement of a tracheostomy [**2104-5-15**]. Sutures around
trach need to be removed in 10 days.  Did well on ventilatory
support; was on PS 10/5/FiO2 0.4; seemed comfortable.  Tried on
PS 5/5/Fi02 0.4 with some success.  Could consider trach mask
trials if pt. wants time off vent.
.
3. Hyponatremia: The pt has baseline hyponatremia ranging
between 120 to 134 with averages in mid 120s. Therefore this
degree of hyponatremia is baseline for pt. However the etiology
of the hyponatremia remains unclear. The pt does not appear
particularly hyper or hypovolemic on physical exam making SIADH
more likely.  TSH and cortisol levels WNL.  Plan to continue
salt tabs and bolus free water through PEJ tube as needed.
Should have biweekly (at least) sodium levels monitored.
.
4. RA: continued prednisone and methotrexate 12.5mg weekly.
.
5. FEN: PEG tube converted to PEJ tube without complications by
GI service.  Novasource 2.0 @ 40 cc/hr.
.
6. Depression: continued Fluoxetine 20 mg/5 mL Solution Daily.
.
7. PPx: Ranitidine 15 mg/mL [**Hospital1 **] as well as colace for GI ppx;
stopped hep SC on d/c given chronic quadriplegia
.
8. Code status: Full code as per pt and her husband.  Palliative
care consulted and pt. focusing on 1 day at a time and wants
full measures at this time.  Should be readdressed periodically
with patient and family.

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler, but can not completely rule out a very
small PFO.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is
moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve is
bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is systolic
doming of the aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve
stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic
regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The
mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS Normal RV systolic function. Low normal LV systolic
function. EF
50-55%. A bioprosthesis is located in the aortic position. It is
well seated
and displays normal leaflet function. There is no aortic
stenosis. There are
two jets of trace aortic regurgitation. The first is clearly
valvular. There
is a second jet that emanates from the region of the native
right coronary
cusp that is directed perpendicularly to the LVOT. The nature of
this jet
suggests a likely perivalvular source but this can not be
confirmed on 2D
imaging. This jet decreased somewhat in intensity after
protamine
administration. Graft material is seen in the ascending aorta.
The thoracic
aorta is intact post-CPB.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68695**] was admitted and underwent replacement of his aortic
valve and ascending aorta by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**]. The operation was
uneventful and he transferred to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring. For further surgical details, please see seperate
dictated operative note. He initially experienced postoperative
coagulopathy which required fresh frozen plasma and platelets.
With blood products, his bleeding quickly improved and no
further intervention was required. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. Beta blockade was
initiated on postoperative day one. His CSRU course was
otherwise uncomplicated and he transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day two. Over several days, beta blockade was
advanced as tolerated. He remained in a normal sinus rhythm. He
continued to make clinical improvments with diuresis and made
steady progress with physical therapy. Given his pericardial
tissue valve, he will need to remain on Aspirin therapy. He was
medically cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day
5.Prior to discharge, his chest x-ray showed only a small
pleural effusions and no evidence of heart failure.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bright red blood per rectum.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old female
with history of hypertension, diabetes type 2, and
diverticulosis by colonoscopy in [**7-10**], who presents with
large volume of BRBPR x2 this a.m.  The patient was unclear
about amount of bleeding, but quantifies it as cupfuls.  She
had 2 more episodes in the ED with 1 episode about 200 cc [**Name8 (MD) **]
RN.  In the ED, her hematocrit was noted to be 37.2 (baseline
36 to 37) and hemodynamically stable with blood pressure
129/88 and pulse 95.  Unfortunately, she failed NG lavage.
She has never had prior GI bleeding and denied chest pain,
shortness of breath, lightheadedness, abdominal pain,
nausea/vomiting, palpitations, recent fevers and chills,
recent NSAID use, GERD, anticoagulation, ETOH.  She received
1.5 liters of normal saline following resuscitation in ED and
was transferred to the floor.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

NIDDM.

Diverticulosis with no history of GI bleed (colonoscopy,
[**7-10**], showing diverticula of sigmoid and descending colon
and grade 1 internal hemorrhoids, otherwise normal to cecum).

Seborrheic keratosis.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission,
1. Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2. KCl 20 mEq p.o. q.d.
3. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Prazosin 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Moexipril 15 mg p.o. q.d.
6. MDI.
7. Calcium carbonate.


ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN WITH UNCLEAR REACTION.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 96323**] with husband
(who is currently hospitalized in Rehab Center with CVA), no
tobacco or ETOH.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs, blood
pressure 124/79, pulse 74, respirations 18, 97 percent on
room air with blood pressure and pulse changing to 99/58 with
pulse of 81 during course of examination.  General:  NAD,
resting on the stretcher, alert and oriented x3.  HEENT:
PERRLA, EOMI, MMM, clear oropharynx, anicteric sclerae.
Neck:  Supple, no JVD, no lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2; no murmurs, rubs,
or gallop.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen:  Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  No
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema, 2 plus PT pulses.  Rectal:
Skin tag at anus with bright red blood noted, good sphincter
tone.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, significant for white count
of 4.3 with 16 neutrophils, 33 lymphocytes, 4 monocytes, 4
eosinophils.  Hematocrit 37.2, platelets 311.  Chemistry is
notable for BUN 26, creatinine 0.9.

On [**2140-5-16**], ECG, normal sinus rhythm at 79 beats per minute,
normal axis and intervals, left atrial enlargement, frequent
PACs, no ST-T wave changes from prior ECG.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Bright red blood per rectum.  Patient was
typed and crossed for several units of packed red cells and
was ensured adequate peripheral IV access and given normal
saline for volume resuscitation.  Over the course of the
evening, she had several more episodes of hematochezia while
attempting to prep for colonoscopy for the following day.
Her hematocrit dropped to 24 over the next several hours and
the patient was sent for packed red blood cell scan given the
active bleeding.  This localized the area of bleeding to the
distal transverse colon just proximal to the splenic flexure.
She was then immediately sent to angiography, which
unfortunately was unable to localize the bleed.  She was
monitored in the MICU for the next several days and
transfused several units of packed red cells for continually
decreasing hematocrit.  She had a colonoscopy on [**2140-5-17**]
showing extensive diverticulosis in the entire colon, though
more concentrated in the left colon, and fresh blood in the
rectosigmoid colon to about 50 cm from the anal verge, but
most concentrated from about 40 to 50 cm and no bleeding
proximally.  While fresh blood was continually seen, no
specific bleeding diverticulum was identified.  She
stabilized over the next few days and continued on IV
Protonix, though the most likely source of bleeding was from
the sigmoid or descending colon, secondary to diverticulosis.
After her hematocrit stabilized with no further episodes of
hematochezia, the patient was transferred to the floor and
prepared for discharge.  Surgery had evaluated the patient
earlier, but did not wish to operate  at this time.  However,
we discussed with the patient that these episodes were likely
to recur and should they recur surgery may be indicated in
the future.

Anemia.  The patient was transfused a total of 8 units of
packed red blood cells during this admission.  She was
started on iron supplements on discharge.

NIDDM.  She was on sliding scale insulin, but will restart
her p.o. hypoglycemics on discharge.

Prophylaxis.  The patient will not need to continue PPI at
home as unlikely to have upper GI lesions.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Diverticulosis.

Lower gastrointestinal bleed.

Hypertension.

Diabetes, non-insulin dependent.

Internal hemorrhoids.

 Multiplanar T1, T2, flare and susceptibility sequences, axial gradient echo 3
 dimensional time of flight sequences with multiple projection reconstructions.

 The examination is compared to prior study of [**2135-9-11**].

 Again is noted the area of parenchymal hematoma formation in the posterior
 left frontal lobe. There is slightly more vasogenic edema surrounding
 this lesion than there was on the prior occasion. There is no definite
 evidence of associated extra-axial accumulation although there is a question
 of some small amount of extra-axial blood superiorly seen on the sagittal
 sequence. Ventricles are unchanged in dimension. The MRA shows no definite
 evidence of aneurysm or flow abnormalities.

 IMPRESSION: Evolutionary changes in left posterior frontal hematoma as
 described above. No definite new findings. No definite evidence of aneurysm.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left frontal cortical bleed

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 67-year-old
right-handed woman who presented to an outside hospital with
right-handed weakness and difficulty speaking.  The history
that the patient was behaving strangely and not speaking
while on the phone with a friend.  [**Name (NI) **] sister went to visit
her, and found her at home, able to answer yes and no
questions, but otherwise nonverbal.  Additionally, the
patient was using her left side despite being right-handed.
She was able to stand up with assistance.  The patient was
taken to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital, where a CT scan of her
midline shift.  At that time, the patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] to the Neurosurgery
service for further evaluation.  The patient was deemed
nonsurgical, and was transferred to the Neurology service for
further evaluation and monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Asthma, schizophrenia, sleep apnea,
hypothyroidism.

ALLERGIES:   Propoxyphene, tetracycline, amoxicillin.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Premarin, Proventil, AeroBid,
Serevent, Zyrtec, Levoxyl, Ativan, Zyprexa, Flovent.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient is a nonsmoker.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 99.1, pulse 108, blood
pressure 120/58, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 97%
on 2 liters.  The patient was lying in bed, in no apparent
distress, with her mouth open, tongue constantly moving.  The
lung examination revealed adventitious sounds, however, there
was no wheezing.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, with good bowel
sounds.

NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:  Mental status:  Patient opens eyes
to voice, will grasp hand, will wiggle toes.  The patient was
nonverbal.  Cranial nerves:  Left pupil was 2 mm, right pupil
was 1.5 mm, both of them were reactive.  There was left lid
ptosis.  The face was symmetric.  There was no nystagmus.
The patient blinks to threat bilaterally.  Motor examination
showed spontaneous movement of the left arm.  The patient
moved her left leg and wiggled the toes.  There was tremor on
the left side, with increased tone.  The right side was
hemiplegic.  Reflexes were 2+ throughout.  The toe was
upgoing on the right and downgoing on the left.  Sensory:
Examination was not withdrawing to pain on the right side.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, revealed white count of
11.5, with a differential of 79 neutrophils, 13 lymphocytes,
1 atypical cell, 4 monocytes, 1 eosinophil, 2 basophils.
Hematocrit 35, platelet count 353.  Chem 7 revealed a sodium
of 136, potassium 4.1, chloride 98, bicarbonate 22, BUN 12,
creatinine 1.3, glucose 143.  Calcium was 9.6, albumin 3.5,
protein 6.7, bilirubin less than 0.5, alkaline phosphatase
93, ALT 26, AST 7.  CK 48, troponin less than 0.04.

An MRI angiogram of the head was obtained, which showed left
frontoparietal lobe hemorrhage with mild surrounding edema.
There was no evidence of abnormal enhancement.  No other
abnormal areas of enhancement in the brain.  Normal MRA of
the head.  Global hemorrhage could be secondary to the
amyloid angiopathy.  No enhancing lesion is identified.
Follow up examination in eight weeks is recommended.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   In summary, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 67-year-old
white female without known vascular risk factors, who
suffered a lobar hemorrhage in the left frontoparietal
region.  She does not have a history of hypertension or
diabetes.  The differential for such bleed would include
amyloid angiopathy, vascular malformation or hemorrhage into
cortical infarct.

Initially the patient was observed in the Intensive Care
Unit, where she did well and was transferred to the Neurology
service.  The patient was started on Dilantin, with current
dose being 300 mg by mouth daily at bedtime.  Initially the
patient's blood pressure was controlled with Nipride, with
transfer to Lopressor and Hydralazine to maintain her blood
pressure between 130 and 150 systolic.

The patient initially was fed through a nasogastric tube,
however, following a swallowing evaluation which revealed
microaspirations with thin fluids, however, no aspiration
with nectars or pudding, thick liquids, the patient was
started on pureed diet with nectar thick liquids.

During this hospitalization, the patient's asthma medication
was continued.  She did not require any nebulizer treatments.

Physical examination on discharge was slightly improved, with
the patient following some midline commands and purposeful
movements of her left arm.  The patient remained nonvocal,
with paralysis of her right arm and leg.

The patient is to follow up with our stroke fellow, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 36006**]
[**Name (STitle) 35880**], as well as her primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will need
a repeat MRI scan in four to six weeks.  At that time,
angiography could also be performed.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Asthma
2.  Schizophrenia
3.  Sleep apnea
4.  Hypothyroidism
5.  Left frontal bleed

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   Flovent two puffs twice a day,
Serevent two puffs twice a day, Proventil two puffs every six
hours as needed, Dilantin 300 mg by mouth daily at bedtime,

 CT HEAD

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Follow up assessment of subdural hematoma.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast axial head CT.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made with prior CT head of [**2106-5-27**].

 Postoperative changes associated with a left frontal craniectomy persist, and
 the overlying skin staples have since been removed.  The subdural hemorrhage
 along the convexity of the left cerebral hemisphere now appears homogenously
 hypodense, indicating evolution of blood products.  A thin layer of
 hyperintense main brain is evident along the deep surface of this subdural
 collection.  A curvilinear area of chronic encephalomalacia is evident at the
 left frontal lobe, extending from the cerebral surface to the lateral wall of
 the left lateral ventricle (series 2, image 20 and 21).

 The postoperative pneumocephalus have since resolved.  There is no
 hydrocephalus, displacement of the normally midline structures, or effacement
 of the basal cisterns.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage is evident.

 Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated.
 Orbital contents maintain normal CT appearances.

 CONCLUSION:  Evolving left subdural hematoma, now appears homogenously
 hypointense, with a hyperdense membrane at its deep surface of the collection
 stop interval resolution of the postoperative pneumocephalus since the prior
 head CT.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage is evident.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old male with DM, recurrent UTI, Paget's, s/p recent
subdural hematoma evacuation admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] w/ respiratory
failure found to have MRSA pna VRE urosepsis, now improved,
called out of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to medicine.
.
# Respiratory distress: Patient was in acute respiratory
distress on admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  He was noted to have thick
bloody secretions on deep suctioning with visible food
particles.  He was intubated and a bronchoscopy was performed on
[**6-18**] which showed inflamed friable mucosa with moderately thick
mucous in the LLL bronchus.  No foreign body was visualized and
a BAL was sent for culture.
His acute respiratory distress was attributed to aspiration PNA
and urosepsis, however, his CXR on [**6-19**] was concerning for
possible ARDS.  He was started on protective ARDS vent settings.
 He was extubated successfully on [**6-20**].  His sputum culture
eventually grew MRSA and patient was continued on Linezolid for
coverage of MRSA PNA and VRE UTI.  Pt also developed pulmonary
edema from fluids that were received, and received lasix for
diuresis with good effects.  Pt's O2 was weaned as tolerated. At
the time of dicharge, pt was satting at 95% on RA.
.
# VRE urosepsis/aspiration, MRSA pneumonia: Patient was admitted
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for sepsis given hypotension, hypoxia, tachycardia,
fever and leukocytosis. The pt was noted to have a UTI.  A
culture sent from the ED grew out enterococcus and patient was
noted to have bibasilar consolidations R > L accompanied by
small-to-moderate pleural effusions concerning for PNA.  Patient
was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Zosyn.
Blood cultures were sent from the ED remained NGTD.  However,
urine cx returned positive for VRE, and patient was started on
Linezolid IV for coverage of his MRSA PNA and VRE UTI.  The BAL
also came back + for MRSA which is covered by linezolid.
Attempted to d/c foley and pt unable to void after trial and
foley was replaced. Will need another voiding trial after
treatment of UTI.
.
# Hypotension:  Patient arrived from the ED on Levophed.  He was
aggressively fluid resuscitated and he was weaned off the
levophed on [**6-19**].  It was noted that the patient was developing
a non-gap hyperchloremic acidosis from the normal saline which
had been used for volume resusciation so his IVF was changed to
lactated ringers with good resolution.  On [**6-18**] he failed his
[**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test and was started on stress-dose steroids.  His
blood pressure stablized and his steroids were continued.  IV
steroid was switched to po and po steroids tapered to off on
[**6-24**].
.
# Mental status changes:  Patient is s/p subdural hematoma
evacuation.  It is unclear what his baseline mental status is
although per report, he is able to follow commands, and there
was a notable decline which in part tiggered this admission.
Likely etiology of new decline in mental status is infection.
Given his past history of CVA, heparin SC was withheld.  Patient
was continued on his seizure prophylaxis with Phenytoin
(currently 9.0; goal [**10-29**]) for his history of subdural
hematoma. He should be continued on this for an additional 2
weeks.
.
# DM: Patient was maintained on an ISS.
.
FEN: Patient was NPO while intubated.  Nutrition was consulted
and tube feeding was initiated on [**6-18**]. Pt self discontinued his
NGT and a swallow study was performed. The video swallow showed
no aspiration but pt should have pills crushed for pocketing. In
addition, he does not have teeth and therefore should cont on
pureed solids. Pt was taking poor PO and had another family
discussion about PEG tube placement. Family does not want a PEG
tube but this should be readdressed with family if pt continues
to take poor PO. Daughter will address with her family. Pt was
started on Megace on [**6-24**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname 43153**] [**Known lastname **] is the former 864
gram product of a 34 week gestation pregnancy born to a 25
year-old G2 P0 woman.  Prenatal screens: blood type 0
positive, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive,
hepatitis B surface antigen negative, group beta strep status
abortion at seven months.  This pregnancy was notable for an
abnormal alpha fetoprotein and triple screen, which was
followed with serial ultrasounds.  They showed normal
biophysical profiles and structurally normal fetus.  There
was a lag in prenatal care.  The mother presented to her [**Name (NI) **]
office on the day of delivery showing poor fetal growth and
reported leaking of amniotic fluid for two months.  On
oligohydramnios were noted.  No kidneys or lungs were
visualized.  She was transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**]
to the [**Hospital1 69**].  She underwent a
cesarean section for concern for fetal heart rate
decelerations.  Apgars were 8 at one minute and 8 at five
minutes.  The baby required blow by O2, drying and bulb
suctioning.  He was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care
Unit for management of his prematurity.

HOSPITAL COURSE/PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA:

Respiratory: [**Known lastname 43153**] was intubated shortly after admission and
given one dose of Surfactant.  He was extubated to nasal cannula
O2 on day of life number one.  He remained on nasal cannula O2
until day of life number twenty five when due to increased
work of breathing he was placed on nasopharyngeal CPAP.  He
remained on the nasopharyngeal continuous positive airway
pressure through day of life number forty nine.  Since that
time he has remained on high flow nasal cannula O2 400 to 500
cc of flow, 45 to 65% fraction of inspired oxygen.  His
evolving chronic lung disease is treated with Diuril.  A
trial of bronchodilators showed no added benefit.  On three
occasions within a week he has had respiratory arrest
events marked by profound bradycardia.  The etiology of these is
unclear, and a bronchoscopic examination is planned at [**Hospital3 18242**] for [**2152-8-30**].

Cardiovascular:  Heart size on chest x-ray was noted to be
large.  An echocardiogram was performed on day of life number
two and showed moderate to severe biventricular dysfunction.
A small pericardial effusion was noted.  The heart
was otherwise structurally normal with a small
atrial septal defect.  The echocardiograms were repeated
several times, which showed gradual improvement in the
cardiomyopathy.  Most recent echocardiogram was on [**2152-8-3**]
showing a moderate atrial septal defect, mild right
ventricular overload and left peripheral pulmonic stenosis.
He required treatment with Dopamine through day of life
number nine.  At the time of discharge his heart rates are in
the 140 to 160 range with mean pressures 50 to 60s.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  [**Known lastname 43153**] was initially NPO
and maintained on intravenous fluids.  He required monitoring
with an umbilical arterial catheter for the first two weeks
of life.  Enteral feeds were started on day of life number
ten and gradually advanced to full volume.  Feedings have
always been well tolerated.  At the time of discharge he is
on mother's breast milk fortified to 34 calories per ounce, 4
with human milk fortifier, 6 by calories by medium chain
triglyceride oil and 4 calories by Polycose.  On a 32
calorie per ounce regimen, he had only gained 9 gms/kg/d.
The etiology of the poor growth is also unknown.  Weight on the
day of discharge is 2.56 kilograms.  Serum electrolytes have
been closely monitored due to the diuretic treatment.  Most
recent electrolytes were on [**2152-8-22**] with a serum sodium of
137, serum potassium of 3.9, chloride 97, PCO2 of 29.  He is
on sodium, potassium, chloride and potassium phosphate
supplements.

Infectious disease:  [**Known lastname 43153**] had a sepsis evaluation at the
time of birth.  A white blood cell count was 4200 with 34%
polys, 9% bands, 49% lymphocytes.  Blood culture was obtained
prior to starting antibiotics.  The culture was no growth.
He received a seven day course of Ampicillin and Gentamycin.
On [**2152-7-10**] an abscess was noted over the left wrist.  The
abscess was unroofed and Citrobacter koseri was cultured.
Due to prior concern for sepsis [**Known lastname 43153**] was being treated with
Vancomycin and Gentamycin.  His coverage was changed to
include Ceftazidime to provide better coverage.  A second
incision and drainage was performed on [**2152-7-28**] and again
the same Citrobacter koseri was cultured.  He received a
total of fourteen days of the Vancomycin, Gentamycin and
Ceftazidime with resolution of the abscess.  Also of concern
with infectious disease with his hepatic workup he was found
to be hepatitis A antibody positive.  Further testing showed
him to have the hepatitis A immunoglobulin negative.

Gastrointestinal:  [**Known lastname 43153**] has presented with some
unidentified liver dysfunction.  An extensive metabolic and
gastrointestinal workup has been undertaken and multiple
metabolic tests sent.  A HIDA scan showed a normal
gallbladder and ruled out biliary atresia, alpha one
antitrypsin level had MM typing.  The only metabolic test
found to be abnormal was the carnitine panel with his level
slightly low, carnitine replacement therapy was started and
his most recent carnitine levels were on [**2152-8-15**].  Free
carnitine is 90 with a range of 27 to 49.  Total is 104 with
a rate of 38 to 68.  The axo carnitine is 14 with a range 7
to 19 and the aso to free carnitine ratio was 0.2 with a
normal of 0.2 to 0.5.  The free and total carnitine levels
being slightly higher then normal range represent the change
on the increased carnitine supplementation.  [**Known lastname 43153**] has also
had an elevated direct bilirubin, which peaked at 8.3 on day
of life 45.  He has been treated with both Phenobarbital and
Actigall.  The Phenobarbital was discontinued [**2152-8-19**].
Most recent direct bilirubin was 6.4 mg per deciliter on
[**2152-8-22**].  PT and PTT were normal on [**8-29**].

Hematologic:  [**Known lastname 43153**] is blood type O positive antibody
negative.  His hematocrit at birth was 36.8%.  He has
received multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells.
Most recent transfusion was on [**2152-7-24**].  Most recent
hematocrit was 31.4% on [**2152-8-22**] with a reticulocyte count
of 3.6%.  He is receiving supplemental iron.

Endocrine:  [**Known lastname 43153**] has had persistent problems with
hypoglycemia despite multiple attempts to wean him from
continuous feeds.  He responds with intermittent blood
glucoses less then 40.  Serum insulin growth hormone and
Cortisol levels have been drawn on numerous occasions with
the episodes of hypoglycemia and all levels have been within
the normal range.  Endocrine consult from [**Hospital3 1810**]
is involved in following.  The etiology of his glucose
requirement is unclear.  It does not appear to be a result of
hyperinsulism and may explain his poor growth.  Endocrine does
not have suggestions at present for further evaluation.  We have
consulted the metabolism team.

Neurology:  Head ultrasound has been performed on two
occasions during his admission.  Both were within normal
limits.

Musculoskeletal:  A fracture of the right humerus was noted
incidentally on a chest x-ray.  This was likely a result of
severe metabolic bone disease.

Sensory:  Audiology screening has not yet been performed.
Ophthalmology, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2281**] defect later described as a coloboma
was noted shortly after birth.  Serial retinal examinations
have been performed and showed mature retinas on [**2152-7-12**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Transfer to [**Hospital3 1810**].  The
primary pediatrician has not yet been identified.

CARE AND RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:  NPO in
preparation for the Operating Room.  When feeding expressed

Immunizations were administered between [**8-8**] and [**2152-8-12**]
and included hepatitis B vaccine, diptheria, cellular
pertussis, hemophilus influenza, the injectable polio vaccine
and the pneumococcal seven valent conjugate vaccine.

Immunizations recommended, Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be
considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval for prior evidence of stroke. Eval cerebral vessels
EXAM: MRI of the brain and MRA of the head and neck.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with left internal carotid artery
occlusion and right ICA stenosis, for further evaluation to
exclude stroke and also to evaluate the cerebral blood vessels.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility and
diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained. 2D
time-of-flight MRA of the neck vessels and 3D time-of-flight MRA
of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] was obtained. Gadolinium- enhanced MRA
of the neck was acquired. The gadolinium-enhanced MRA is
somewhat limited possibly related to delay in timing and venous
contamination. Source images were evaluated to obtain maximum
information.

FINDINGS:

BRAIN MRI:

The diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
Mild-to- moderate brain atrophy seen. No evidence of territorial
infarcts noted. Minimal changes of small vessel disease are
noted in the white matter. No evidence of acute or chronic blood
products seen.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct. Mild-to-moderate brain
atrophy.

MRA OF THE NECK:

The neck MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in the right
vertebral artery. The right internal carotid demonstrates
high-grade approximately 70% stenosis at the bifurcation. The
evaluation of the right carotid stenosis on the post- gadolinium
MRA is limited secondary to venous contamination.

The left internal carotid is occluded at the bifurcation. No
flow is visualized in the distal cervical left internal carotid
artery. No flow is seen in the left petrous carotid artery.

The evaluation of the left vertebral artery on source images
demonstrate flow signal in a markedly narrowed left vertebral
artery in the proximal portion. Subtle flow signal is also seen
in the left V3 segment of the vertebral artery. This finding is
indicative of diffuse atherosclerotic disease involving the left
vertebral artery. The visualized great vessels of the thoracic
inlet demonstrate no evidence of high-grade stenosis.

IMPRESSION: 1. Occlusion of the left internal carotid artery at
the bifurcation. 2. High-grade stenosis of the right internal
carotid bifurcation. Normal right vertebral artery. 3. Diffuse
atherosclerotic disease involving left vertebral artery with
partial visualization in the proximal and distal portions.

MRA OF THE HEAD:

The head MRA demonstrates absence of flow signal in the distal
left internal carotid artery. The supraclinoid internal carotid
artery is minimally visualized with flow visualized from the
left PCA to the left middle cerebral artery. On the right side
normal flow signal is seen in the supraclinoid internal carotid,
right MCA and both anterior cerebral arteries. The posterior
communicating artery is also visualized on the right side.

In the posterior circulation, diffuse narrowing of the basilar
artery is visualized with absence of flow signal in the distal
basilar artery indicative of diffuse atherosclerotic disease
with high-grade stenosis or occlusion of the distal basilar
artery. Both distal vertebral arteries demonstrate narrowed flow
signal caliber.

IMPRESSION:
1. Occlusion of the left internal carotid with collateral flow
to the left MCA through the left posterior communicating artery.
Normal flow signal in the right supraclinoid internal carotid,
right MCA and both anterior cerebral arteries. Diffuse
atherosclerotic disease of the basilar artery with probable
occlusion or high-grade stenosis in the distal basilar artery.

appear unremarkable. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast
symmetrically. Again seen are hypodensities which are
incompletely characterized on the current study in both kidneys.
The loops of small and large bowel appear normal in caliber. A
nasogastric tube terminates in the antrum of the stomach.
Contrast has reached the distal small bowel. There is no
evidence of extraluminal contrast. A surgical drain is seen in
the right upper quadrant. There is ascites fluid in the right
upper quadrant, tracking down the right pericolic gutter, there
is higher density posteriorly suggesting some blood. There are
also foci of free intraperitoneal air consistent with the recent
surgery. Skin staples are seen across the anterior abdomen, and
there is mild subcutaneous soft tissue stranding. No fluid
collections are identified within the abdomen. There is some
stranding in the right upper quadrant in the region of the
recent surgery. Vascular structures demonstrate atherosclerosis
of the abdominal aorta. The major arteries and veins are patent.

CT OF THE PELVIS: A Foley catheter is seen within the bladder,
and there is nondependent air in the bladder lumen. The
prostate, seminal vesicles and rectum appear unremarkable. There
is small amounts of free fluid in the pelvis. Note of a small
left-sided fat-containing inguinal hernia.

ULTRASOUND-GUIDED PERIHEPATIC FLUID COLLECTION DRAINAGE.

HISTORY: 72-year-old male s/p transduodenal ampullary resection
with elevated while blood count and fever and fluid collection
around the liver

PROCEDURE: The risks and benefits of the procedure were
explained to the patient. Written informed consent was obtained.
Preprocedure timeout was called to confirm the identity of the
patient and the procedure to be performed. The patient was
prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1%
was used for local anesthesia.

Moderate sedation was provided, by a nurse, by administering
divided doses of 25 mcg of fentanyl and 0.5 mg of Versed,
throughout the total intraservice time of 20 minutes during
which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously
monitored.

Under direct ultrasound guidance with freehand technique, a
suitable spot in the right upper quadrant was chosen and after
administration of lidocaine, an 8-French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter was
placed into the perihepatic fluid collection.

110 cc of greenish fluid were aspirated. A sample was sent for
microbiology.

The patient tolerated well the procedure.

There were no complications.

The attending radiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was present during the
entire procedure.

The patient tolerated well the procedure.

IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided placement of drainage

CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 72-year-old man postoperative day 16, status post
transit duodenal ampullectomy for ampullary mass, also
cholecystectomy with fevers and leukocytosis on antibiotics.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images were obtained through the
abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast. Coronal
and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.

COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis [**2173-6-13**].

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases show right lower
lobe atelectasis with a moderate-sized right pleural effusion
and small left pleural effusion. The size of the pleural
effusions have not significantly changed since the prior scan.
The heart and pericardium are unremarkable. Within the abdomen,
there has been interval placement of a pigtail drainage catheter
within the lateral perihepatic collection, and there is less
fluid and air within this collection. There has been interval
development of a new fluid collection posterior to the right
lobe of the liver measuring 4.0 (anterior to posterior) by 6.7
(transverse) by 6.8 (superior to inferior) cm. The fluid within
this collection is of low density and there is no surrounding,
enhancing rim. There are no focal liver lesions. The previously
identified air within the biliary system has resolved. There is
no biliary ductal dilatation. The patient is status post
cholecystectomy. The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are
normal in appearance. Again seen are tiny hypodensities within
the bilateral kidneys, the largest of which is within the mid
pole of the left kidney, and measures 13 mm, and is most
consistent with a simple renal cyst. The remaining low-density
foci within the kidneys are too small to characterize. The
kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter. There is
an unchanged amount of intraabdominal ascites. Again seen is a
surgical drain coursing from the second portion of the duodenum
posterior to the liver and exiting the abdomen through the right
lower abdominal wall. This drain does not appear to communicate
with the newly identified liver subcapsular fluid collection.
The stomach and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel
are unremarkable in appearance. There is no bowel dilatation,
bowel wall thickening, or inflammatory fat stranding within the
mesenteric fat. There is no pathologically enlarged mesenteric
or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. There is no free air.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon,
seminal vesicles, prostate, distal ureters, and bladder are
normal in appearance. There is no pathologically enlarged
inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy. There is an unchanged
small-to-moderate amount of intrapelvic free fluid. There is a
small fat-containing left inguinal hernia, which is unchanged.
There is edema in the subcutaneous tissues consistent with
anasarca.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1. New, approximately 4 x 6 cm subcapsular fluid collection
posterior to the right lobe of the liver. .

2. Interval placement of a percutaneous pigtail catheter within
the previously identified fluid- and air-containing collection
lateral to the right lobe of the liver. Interval decreased in
size of this collection from the prior scan of [**2173-6-13**].

3. Unchanged small amount of intraabdominal ascites.

4. Left lower lung lobe atelectasis, stable, with stable size of
bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.

These findings were discussed with the clinical team and
infectious disease team caring for the patient at the time of
interpretation at 3:00 p.m. on [**2173-6-22**].

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old man w/p Whipple, CCY on [**6-3**] for a bleeding ampulary
mass.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please drain hepatic fluid collection. Do not leave drain unless
puss. Please send fluid for Gram stain, culture, and amylase.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CLINICAL DETAILS: Post-op. Loculated posterior perihepatic fluid
collection. Existing catheter in situ.

PROCEDURE:

Pre-procedure written consent and confirmation of patient
identity and nature of procedure performed. The patient was
placed in a lateral position to allow accfess to the loculated
6.7 cm x 4.1 cm fluid density collection along the right
posterior superior aspect of the liver. Following usual aseptic
technique, local and intravenous analgesia using a right
posterior intercostal approach, a 10 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] multipurpose
pigtail catheter was inserted into this fluid collection.
Initial aspiration yielded 10-15 cc of serous fluid samples, of
which have been sent for microbiological culture, Gram stain,
and amylase. No immediate complications. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (attending
Radiologist) was present.

CT-GUIDED MANIPULATION OF EXISTING PIGTAIL CATHETER

The non-contrast CT scan confirms the existing pigtail catheter
in good position along the lateral aspect of the right lobe of
the liver. Minimal residual rim of fluid density measuring up to
1.6 cm in depth. The existing 8-French pigtail catheter was
flushed and aspirated. Minimal (less than 5 cc) amount of serous
fluid aspirated.

NON-CONTRAST CT SCAN OF THE ABDOMEN:

Minimal right basal pleural effusion, consolidation in the
posteromedial aspect of the right lower lobe. On the unenhanced
CT, no liver lesions or intrahepatic biliary dilatation. No
upper abdominal collections or lymphadenopathy.

CONCLUSION:

1. Successful placement of 10-French pigtail catheter into the
loculated right posterior perihepatic fluid collection,

2. The existing multipurpose pigtail catheter line was flushed
and aspirated and remains in good position along the lateral
aspect of the right lobe of liver. Minimal (less than 1.6 cm)
rim of fluid at that level.

Addendum added by: DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Doctor Last Name 15706**]/jg????????????
Date: [**2173-6-16**]

Clinical: Pancreatic mass.

Gross:

The specimen is received in fresh in three, each labeled with
the patient's name, ""[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]"" and the medical record
number.



Part 1 is additionally labeled ""gallbladder"". The specimen
consists of a single intact distended gallbladder measuring 11.3
x 4.6 x 4.4 cm. The serosa is tan-pink and focally red and the
specimen is opened longitudinally to reveal approximately 30 cc
of dark brown honey-colored viscus fluid. There is a single
green gallstone measuring 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm which is bisected
to reveal a green crystalline interior. The mucosa is tan-pink
and notable for multiple small yellow flecks. The wall thickness
measures up to 0.2 cm. The specimen is sectioned and represented
as follows: cystic duct margin and body in A1, fundus in B1.



Part 2 is additionally labeled ""right lateral margin"". The
specimen consists of a single piece of soft pink red tissue
measuring 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. One side of the specimen has
either been previously inked in black or darkened by cautery.
This side is inked over in black. There is a single suture
demarcating one side of the specimen which is inked in yellow
and the specimen is submitted entirely with the black ink side
face down, in cassette labeled C1.



Part 3 additionally labeled ""ampullary adenoma"" consists of a
2.3 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm polypoid fragment of tan pink mucosa
containing a 0.4 cm stalk. The stalk has been identified by the
surgeon with a blue stitch and contains the pancreatic and
biliary duct margins.  There is a 0.3 cm area of mucosal
ulceration at one end of the polyp. The resection margin is
inked black, shaved off and submitted for frozen section
diagnosis en face. A representative cross section of the polyp
is also submitted for frozen section diagnosis.  Frozen section
diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is ""ampullary adenoma with
focal high grade dysplasia. No invasion seen on sampled
sections. The adenoma focally extends to the side margin.  The
shaved common bile duct and pancreatic duct margin are free of
dysplasia.""  The stalk margin frozen section remnant is entirely
submitted in A and the polyp frozen section remnant is entirely
submitted in B. The remainder of the specimen is serially
sectioned and entirely submitted in C-E, with the ulcerated area
in D.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2173-5-26**]. An ERCP with biopsy showed
adenocarcinoma. A CT confirmed the presence of an Ampullary
Mass.

#Carotid Disease
A noninvasive carotid study showed complete occlusion of the
left ICA and the right ICA with 70-79% narrowing.

#Vascular consult
An Angio obtained form an OSH ([**Doctor Last Name **], [**3-1**]) showed the
right ICA to be 35%  occluded. A neuro consult was requested to
work up his TIA's vs. Parkinsonism. A MRI Brain/ MRA carotids
revealed mild-to-moderate brain atrophy and occlusion of the
left internal carotid artery at the bifurcation, high-grade
stenosis of the right internal carotid bifurcation. Normal right
vertebral artery, normal flow signal in the right supraclinoid
internal carotid, right MCA and both anterior cerebral arteries.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that there was no intervention needed prior to
abdominal surgery.

#Neuro consult
Neuro found no evidence of symptomatic right brain lesion on
exam, but there may be a small stroke not detected clinically.

#Cardiology Consult
Cardiology recommended an Echo and Stress Mibi which were
negative for ST changes and showed normal myocardial perfusion,
and normal left ventricular cavity
size and function.

He was then cleared to go to the OR on [**2173-6-3**] and had an Open
Cholecystectomy and Transduodenal Ampullary Resection. He
tolerated the procedure well. He was NPO, had a NGT and IV
fluids. He was started on a PCA for pain control. He needed
further teaching on the use of his PCA before he was able to
have pain control.He had a JP drain in place and staples to his
abdominal incision.

#Pain Consult
A pain consult was obtained after the patient required Narcan
for sedation, a respiratory rate of 8, and pinpoint pupils. APS
recommended that he continue with subcutaneous Dilaudid until he
is able to take PO meds. He was then changed to PO Dilaudid on
POD 6.

#Seizure
POD 3, the patient had a 30 second episode of
non-responsiveness, blank downward gaze and increase fine
tremors of the bilateral upper extremities, right>left.
Afterwards, he was unable to remember the names of his
daughters, or remember the event. The family states that the
last seizure was 5 years ago. Neurology was consulted and
recommended Ativan IV for any further seizure activity and to
restart Tegretal 200mg TID once he is able to take POs. He was
restarted on Tegretal on POD 4, and has had no further seizure
activity.

POD 4, a UGI SGL CONTRAST W/ KUB showed no evidence of leak at
the duodenal anastomosis. The NGT was D/C'd and he was started
on sips. His diet was advanced as bowel function returned. Stool
was sent for C.diff due to a frequent loose stool which was
negative.

POD 6, he was found down on the floor, obtund ed. He denies
hitting his head, he was reportedly confused and talking, but
thought it was [**2146**]. Neurology was called immediately. Labs were
sent and a Tegretol level was adequate at 7.6, WBC 28.4 and temp
of 101.9 axillary. He then became diaphoretic and was not
responding to questions and was not opening his eyes. It seems
likely that the patient was confused due to sepsis and
hypotension as opposed to a seizure related event. He was
transfered to the SICU. He was given IV fluids and started on
Vancomycin, Levo, Flagyl. A head CT showed no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

On [**2173-6-13**] he spiked a fever to 102F. An Abdominal CT on [**2173-6-13**]
showed no evidence of drainable fluid collection or abscess, but
increased bilateral pleural effusions. He was started on Zosyn
(Levo/Flagyl D/C'd) and continued the Vancomycin.
A JP amylase on [**2173-6-14**] was [**Numeric Identifier 67347**]. On POD 12 a UGI/Air with KUB
showed no evidence of a leak.

His JP revealed [**Female First Name (un) 564**] and he was started on Fluconazole. His
WBC continued to be elevated 28.4, 33.5, 29.6, 23.5, 15.8, 20.6,
17.3, up to 33.7 on POD 13.
Infectious Disease was consulted and they suggested broad
spectrum antibiotics and that we should sample the pleural
effusion.

POD 13, A PICC line was placed and he was started on TPN.
POD 14, Urine cultures were negative. he continued to spike a
temperatures, up to 102.4 and he had increased work of
breathing. Interventional Pulmonology was contact to perform a
thoracentesis for the right sided pleural effusion and they
removed 1.2 liters of fluid. The pleural effusion was negative.
Occupational and physical therapy was consulted and he was
started on aggressive pulmonary toilet.
POD 15 a left subdiaphragmatic collection was drained by US
guidance seen on the [**6-13**] CT.  The drain was negative for
bacteria and positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.
POD 19 on an interval CT scan there was a subcapsular fluid
collection.  Unclear the etiology.
POD 22 The Subscapular fluid collection was drained by CT
guidance.  The cultures have been negative for bacteria.
POD 24:  The subscapular pigtail was d/c'd
POD 25: The pigtail drain the fluid around the liver was d/c'd

Imaging:
CXR [**10-3**] IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular
congestion.  In the appropriate clinical setting, atypical
pneumonia could also be considered.  Also, although it is
difficult to exclude focal pneumonia at the lung bases, patchy
basilar opacities with low lung volumes could also be seen with
atelectasis.

Cardiac Echo [**2170-10-4**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
35-40 %) with regional hypokinesis in basal-mid lateral
hypo/akinesis and apical hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-8-4**],
the wall motion abnormalities and overall ejection fraction are
similar. The degree of mitral regurgitation has increased but
was probably underestimated on the prior study.
IMPRESSION: Regional wall motion abnormalities in the inferior,
lateral and apical territories with reduced ejection fraction to
30-35%. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic
regurgitation.

CXR [**2170-10-4**]
COMPARISON:  [**2170-10-3**].

FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung
volumes have
minimally increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.
Otherwise, the
radiograph is unchanged, including the pre-existing
mild-to-moderate
cardiomegaly.  No pleural effusions are seen.  No evidence of
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
87 year old male with productive cough x3 weeks and new onset of
dyspnea on day prior to presentation who was admitted to the
MICU originally for BIPAP and quickly weaned off of it and
transferred to the medical [**Hospital1 **].

# Dyspnea: most likely represents CHF exacerbation in setting of
progressive orthopnea as well as contribution from concurrent
COPD exacerbation. Likely exacerbated by abdominal wall tension
with large amounts of bowel gas. ABG on bipap shows mild
respiratory acidosis. Patient has previous spirometry results
indicative of underlying restrictive pathology as well. His
respiratory status improved after diuresis and he was weaned off
fo Bipap and stable on NC and transferred to the medical [**Hospital1 **].
On the floor he continued saturate comfortably on room air. In
addition, he was placed on steroid burst and azithromycin x 5
days for COPD flare.

# CHF: Last echo [**7-/2169**] shows LVEF of 35-40%. Patient received
repeat echo on hospital day 2 with final report pending upon
call out from ICU. Patient was continued on home CHF medications
of Diovan, metoprolol and Lasix. Echo without marked interval
change, EF 30-35%.

# Abdominal distension: KUB shows diffuse bowel gas, no air
fluid levels or signs of obstruction. Abdominal exam currently
without tenderness or rebound, not concerning for acute abdomen.
Distension preceded Bipap initiation per the patient. Patient
endorses normal BMs and continues passing some gas per rectum.
Patient received Simethicone overnight with minimal improvement
in bowel gas, also received aggressive bowel regimen.

# CKD: Cr noted to be at high end of patient's baseline, trended
down.

Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 108821**],

It was a pleasure participating in your care at [**Hospital1 771**].

You were admitted to the hospital because you were short of
breath due to a flare up of your chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease. You were given inhalers and nebulizers, as well as
steroids and antibiotics that both reduce inflammation and
protect against potential infection.

Medication Changes:
INCREASED prednisone to 40mg a day for [**10-6**] and [**10-7**], then
continue taking your home dose of 5mg daily

 INDICATION:  CABG, cough, evaluate for pneumonia.

 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:  Comparison is made to [**2131-1-17**].  The study is
 limited due to technique.  Again seen are sternal wires and changes from prior
 coronary artery bypass surgery. The lung volumes are unchanged since the prior
 study.  Seen on the lateral radiograph is increased opacity in a posterior
 costophrenic sulcus which likely indicates a left pleural effusion.  Patchy
 areas of bilateral atelectasis are present. There is increased opacity in the
 retrocardiac left lower lobe which could be due to atelectasis or pneumonia.
 There is increased opacity at the right anterior CP angle which could be due
 to a prominent cardiac fat pad.  This was present on the prior study as well.
 The osseous structures are unchanged.

 IMPRESSION:  Poor technique.  Worsening left lower lobe opacity and small left
 effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 36444**] is a 70 yo male with h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia with
+ETT, s/p cath showing which demonstrated critical stenosis of
the LAD.  He has initially admitted to the medical service, and
subsequently underwent OP CAGBx1 on [**2131-1-15**].  His postoperative
course was fairly routine.  He was transferred from the CSRU to
the cardiac floor on POD#1.  He did develop post-op atrial
fibrilation requiring amiodarone, which chemically cardioverted
him to NSR.  He recovered from that point on and his chest tubes
were d/c'd on POD#2.  He ambulated with physical therapy and was
deemed ready to be discharged home on POD#6.

FINDINGS: There is a type III dense fracture which extends
through the body of C2 into the right lateral mass. There is a
fracture line that extends into the foramen transverse sarium on
the right side. The fracture fragments are minimally displaced.
There is no retropulsion into the cervical spinal canal. There
are prominent degenerative changes in the mid cervical spine
with degenerative disk disease of C3-C7. There is also prominent
facet arthropathy at these levels as well. There is high
attenuation in epidural space spanning from C1-C3. This
abormality is consistent with a small epidural hematoma. There
is CSF attenuation remaining surrounding the cervical spinal
cord.
There is pronounced arterial vascular calcification and
bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:
1. Type III dens fracture with extent into the lateral mass of
C2 and involves the right foramen transverse sarium. There is a
small epidural hematoma spanning from C1-C3.
2. Diffuse spondylytic changes in the mid to lower cervical
spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Nondisplaced fracture through the anterior superior end plate
of T2 and nondisplaced fracture of the left 8th rib.
2. No evidence of compression of the spinal cord in the thoracic
spine.

IMPRESSION:
1) Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. There is no
intra or extrahepatic ductal dilatation identified. However, the
distal common bile duct and pancreas were not visualized due to
overlying bowel gas.
2) Small septated cyst and small granuloma in the left lobe of
the liver.
3) Small amount of fluid in the abdomen seen above the liver
dome.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2183-10-30**] transferred from an OSH with
the fractures described above. He was admitted to the trauma
SICU for stabilization and close monitoring. His CT head was
negative for acute intercranial injury. He received FFP and
vitamin K for his elevated INR (2.6). His scalp laceration was
repaired with staples. He remained hemodynamically and
neurologically stable in the SICU, and developed no new
neurologic deficits. His motor and sensory exam was normal and
remained so throughout his hospitalization.
On HD4 he was transferred to the floor. On the floor, he had
some episodes of agitation, mostly at night, that required
haloperidol prn. On HD6 he was found to be dyspneic with
decreased O2 sats to the low 90s. His chest xray showed slight
fluid overload. He was given lasix 20, and nebulizer treatments,
with an improvement in his respiratory status, to O2 sats in the
high 90s.
On HD7, he failed a swallow test, and on HD8 a PICC line was
placed to provide nutrition via TPN.
On HD8, he was found to be slightly jaundiced, and LFTs revealed
a hyperbilirubinemia (50% direct, 50% indirect). Liver fellow
was consulted. RUQ ultrasound showed cholelithiasis with no
evidence of cholecystitis, normal ducts. He was started on
ursodiol 300.
On HD10 he self d/c'd his PICC line. Re-evaluation by the
swallow consult showed that he passed for soft solids and
thickened liquids. He was restarted on PO feedings with
assistance.
Throughout his stay on the floor, he had occasional tachycardia
to the 140s, while in afib. these were treated with additional
doses of IV metoprolol. He had no such tachycardia the 2 days
prior to discharge, and required no additional beta-blocker.
On HD12 he was started on PO medications which he tolerated
well.
He was seen by PT/OT, which will be continued upon discharge.
He was transferred to rehab on HD 13 with follow-up with
neurosurgery, and a c-collar to stay on for 12 weeks.

History of Present Illness:
78 year old man with multiple medical problems including CAD s/p
recent
RCA Taxil stent [**1-18**], AF and sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker
in [**3-20**] revised in [**4-20**], CHF with EF 45% recently admitted from
[**Date range (1) 9184**] for atypical chest pain (no interventions) comes in this
AM for elective cardiac cath to evaluate for restrictive
cardiomyopathy.  During the procedure his pressures dropped from
the 130s/80s to sbp of 70s, he also was somnolent (?due to
versed and fentanyl).  He was not responsive to atropine, or to
low doses of dopamine, but responded to 15mcg/kg/min of
dopamine.  EKG not consistent with ischemia, no other s/s.  The
patient was admitted to the CCU for close monitoring.

Given his symmetric LVH, diseases such as sarcoid and amyloid
were possible but pt has not wanted a biopsy to date.  An ECHO
earlier this month showed severe symmetric LVH, inferior and
septal hypokinesis, an EF 45% as above, a small pericardial
effusion, and an abnormally small LV cavity (which is not
reported on a repeat ECHO this admission).  The last two
findings are new since [**10-19**].  An exercise stress test as well
as a persantine stress test earlier this month were both
prematurely terminated after the patient dropped his pressures.
He had a normal ETT in '[**31**] and an ETT with elevation in his BP
with exercise in [**10-19**].

Cardiac Cath ([**7-16**]):
COMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed two
vessel
coronary disease.  The LMCA had mild, diffuse plaquing.  The LAD
was
moderately calcified but contained no flow-limiting disease.  A
D1
branch contained a modest sized, long lower pole 80% stenosis.
The LAD
wrapped around the apex. The LCX had mild luminal irregularities

throughout but was otherwise without flow-limiting disease.  The
RCA had
an ostial 40% stenosis that resulted in pressure dampening on
engagement
of the vessel.  This was somewhat attenuated with use of a JR5
catheter.
The proximal RCA stent was patent with a relative 50-60%
stepdown
afterwards.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated mean RA pressure of
16mmHg.
PCPW tracing was difficult to acquire and actual measurements
probably
represented a hybrid of PCPW and PA pressure.  LVEDP was
elevated at
20mmHg.  Cardiac output via the Fick method was 3.4 l/min with a
cardiac
index of 1.8 l/min/m2.
3.  Left ventriculography was not performed.
4.  Central aortic pressure was low immediately after obtaining
arterial
access.  Pressure was approximately 80/60.  The patient had no
symptoms
of lightheadedness or back pain.  Administration of atropine and

flumazenil (to reverse the versed given before the case) did not
improve
the blood pressure.  The patient did not respond to infusions of

dopamine at 5 or 10 mcg/kg/min.  Ultimately, at 15 mcg/kg/min,
the blood
pressure rose to 120/80 with a pulse in the 70s.  Cardiac output
on
7.5mcg/kg/min dopamine was 3.7 l/min.
5.  A STAT echocardiogram done in the cath lab revealed
""bradycardic""
appearing heart with EF 40% and no evidence of effusion.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Diastolic dysfunction.

ECHO ([**7-16**]):
Conclusions:
1. Limited focused study.
2. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
3.The right atrium is moderately dilated.
4.There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%). Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include basal
and mid septal hypokinesis.
5.The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right
ventricular chamber
size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
6.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No color
doppler study
was done to assess for the presence of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
8.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential.
9. An echogenic density in the right ventricle is present
consistent with a
pacemaker lead.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2142-7-5**], the
pericardial effusion is much less. The overall function is
unchanged.

CT Abd, non contrast ([**7-16**]) r/o retroperitoneal bleed
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal or groin hemorrhage.
2. Moderate size bilateral pleural effusion effusions and
bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Innumerable punctate low-attenuation liver lesions. These are
likely benign but are too small to characterize.
4. Irregular thickened bladder wall. This may be partially due
to incomplete distention of the bladder. There is likely a small
right bladder diverticulum. Further evaluation of the bladder
wall with direct visualization should be considered.
5. Left hydrocele.

EKG ([**7-16**]): c/w LBBB as patient is paced; no evidence of acute
STEMI, no change on [**7-17**].

CT chest ([**2142-6-20**]): small calcifications c/w granulomas in LLL
and RUL, as well as in liver.  Pulmonary nodule in LUL.  Small
mediatstinal nodes.  Small b/l pleural effusions. Small
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Cardiovascular
A. Rate/Rhythm - The patient had underlying AF, SSS with pacer
in place. He came in on a beta blocker. These were held the day
of catheterization but were added back the following day.  While
here he was well controlled on this regimen.  Coumadin still
held in anticipation of biopsy.  No anticoagnulation at present.
B. Pump - The patient came in on an ACEI, lasix, and digoxin.
These meds were held the day of catheterization ([**7-16**]) but
reinitiated the following day.  He had an episode of hypotension
requiring dopamine drip during catheterization but was weaned
off the drip the same evening.  His EF was 45%.  He also
received two additional IV doses of Lasix on [**7-17**] while he
received 2 units of PRBCs with good UOP afterwards.
C. CAD - s/p RCA stent in [**1-18**], and since has had the pump
problems above. His Asprin 81mg was continued during this
admission.
D. Pericardial effusion - small, but new since [**10-19**]. Stable
issue during this admission.
E. Symmetric LVH: Seen on ECHO, and differential includes
diseases such as amyloid and sarcoid.  A cardiac biopsy for
tissue dx was planned while the patient was admitted.  However,
his INR was somewhat evevated after having stopped coumadin and
was 1.7 on [**7-17**].  Therefore he was given Vitamin K with a
decrease in his INR to 1.5 on [**7-18**].  The interventional
cardiologist felt that the INR should be lower, and that the
patient should be placed on lovenox and return for the biopsy
next week.  This was scheduled for Tuesday, [**7-24**].  He was given
another dose of Vitamin K on [**7-18**] and will get his INR checked on
Saturday.
*
2. Pulmonary - The patient maintained good sats with 2L NC. He
had calcifications c/w granulomatous dz in liver and lung,
possible sarcoid or TB.
- ACE level pending on discharge
- PPD placed  ([**7-16**]) - negative on [**7-18**]
*
3. Renal - The patient had chronic renal insufficiency of
unclear etiology. His creatinine was stable over the past one
month, and during his hospitalization.
*
4. ID - During admission the patient remained afebrile, without
a white count.
*
5. GI - After his procedure, the patient was advanced to a
cardiac diet. LFT abnormalities on admission were lower than
earlier this month.
*
6. GU - s/p TURP c/b hematuria in the past so was not on plavix
for his stent.  Foley dc'd [**7-18**] AM.
*
7. Heme/Onc - HCT 36.7 after 2 units ([**7-17**]), up from 28.6. INR
1.5 on [**7-18**] after Vitamin K given on [**7-17**], he was given another
dose on [**7-18**].  Previously on coumadin - held on Friday for
procedure.  The coumadin was held, and the patient was sent home
on lovenox until procedure Tuesday.
*
8. Endo - glucose stable in low 100s. HISS with qid FS. Earlier
this month FT4 was mildly elevated at 1.9 with normal TSH at
3.8.
*
9. Psych - no issues, wife supportive.
*
10. Proph - ppi, heparin sq, bowel regimen, tylenol.  C/o
constipation so increased bowel regimen.
*
11. Drains/Tubes/Lines - right groin arterial and venous access
- dc'd at 2:45pm on [**7-16**]; now with L PIV.
*
12. Dispo - sent home on [**7-18**] to return for biopsy next Tuesday
[**7-24**].

INDICATION: 79-year-old male with a right upper extremity DVT.
TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left
common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were
performed. There is no normal flow, compressibility, and
augmentation of these vessels. No intraluminal thrombus was
identified. There is no evidence of DVT.
Examination of area of ecchymosis in the thigh demonstrates a
small hypoechoic area, which could represent a tiny hematoma,
which measures 2.5 x 0.5 x 2.0 cm and is very small.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.



Brief Hospital Course:
29-year-old gentleman who has suffered trauma including a blunt
blow to the chest. He presented with a large pneumothorax to an
area hospital where a chest tube was placed. He was transferred
to this institution with a pulmonary infiltrate, which was
consistent partially with re expansion pulmonary edema and
possibly a lower lobe pneumonia. After stabilized in the trauma
bay he was admitted to the Trauma ICU under the care of the
Trauma Service.

On [**5-29**] he developed acute right neck and shoulder pain with
swelling; he underwent unilateral ultrasound which confirmed a
thrombus in the subclavian region. He was started on Heparin
drip and later changed to Lovenox and Coumadin and was

On [**5-30**] he developed increasing subcutaneous emphysema and
pneumothorax for which he received an additional chest tube; a
flexible bronchoscopy was performed to rule out airway injury;
there were no anatomic or mucosal abnormalities noted. His chest
tubes were removed on [**6-4**], follow up chest xray with tiny
residual pneumothorax.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Altered mental status.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 56-year-old man
with known brain cancer (oligodendroglioma), who presented to
the ED on [**3-13**] with worsening mental status and a left
leg ulcer.  Patient had been increasingly confused over the
past few days and possibly had a fall a few days prior to
admission.

On the day of admission, VNA noticed an abscess on the left
leg and sent patient to the Emergency Room, where he was
found to be afebrile, but hypotensive with a systolic blood
pressure of 95.  Patient finished chemotherapy and also had
some partial seizures last week.  He has had seizures since
[**2165**].  Head CT [**3-13**] showed new bleed around temporal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle and at tip of the inferior
right temporal lobe.  In the Emergency Room, he received more
than 3 liters of fluid.  He was given stress-dosed steroids,
and he had an I&D of his left leg ulcer, and was started on
Zosyn.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Oligodendroglioma versus oligoastrocytoma anaplastic
diagnosed [**2166-3-24**].  [**2166-3-24**] he had a MRI for
infertility.  Later in the year he had temozolomide, and he
has had persistent seizures.  In [**2167-12-24**], he had an
increasing enhancement and was started on radiation therapy
as well as temozolomide and dexamethasone.
2. History of line sepsis.
3. Neurologic symptoms, encephalopathy secondary to tumor,
recent increase in weakness and inability to ambulate
possibly secondary to steroid myopathy.  In addition, he has
a left field cut in vision.
4. Hyperglycemia (steroid induced).

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Celebrex 200 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lamictal 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Keppra 1500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Dexamethasone 2 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Valproate 250 mg p.o. q.i.d.
7. Neurontin 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.
8. Inderal 60 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Seroquel 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. t.i.d. prn.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa causes hives.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is an anesthesiologist.  He lives
with his wife.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the
MICU for close observation overnight, and the patient did
well.  The following day he was transferred to the floor and
remained stable throughout.

1. Intracranial hemorrhage:  Repeat CT on [**3-14**] showed
no change from the previous day.  Neurology and Neurosurgery
were consulted.  Neurosurgery team felt that the bleed is
stable and there is no need for surgical intervention at this
time.  The goal is to keep the systolic blood pressure less
than 140.  No new neurologic deficits.  Hematocrit dropped
from 33 to 30 during this admission, which is felt to be
insignificant.

2. Hypotension:  Patient was hypotensive on admission, but
quickly responded to fluid challenge and blood pressure has
since been greater than 100 systolic.  Patient is
hemodynamically stable and has been afebrile since admission.
Was given stress-dose steroids for two days, and was switched
back to dexamethasone.  Also Inderal was held on admission,
and has not been restarted as blood pressure has been less
than 120 throughout admission.

3. Left leg cellulitis:  Patient was started on Zosyn for two
days and changed to Augmentin for one day.  He was finally
changed to Levaquin on the day of discharge as the patient
has concomitant questionable pneumonia.  Continue wet-to-dry
dressing changes b.i.d. with saline.

4. Hyperglycemia secondary to steroids:  Patient was
continued on regular insulin-sliding scale.

5. Hypertension:  Inderal was held on admission.  Blood
pressure is still borderline low, so Inderal was discontinued
altogether.

6. Seizure disorder:  Patient had been having seizures
lately.  Was taking Lamictal, valproate, and Keppra on
admission.  Neurology recommended stopping Lamictal, which
was done.  Valproate dose was increased on [**3-14**] and is
still subtherapeutic on the day of discharge.  This will need
to be followed up as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**],
neuro-oncologist, was e. mailed to be made aware of the
subtherapeutic valproate level.

7. Brain cancer:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] from the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic will
follow up with the patient for one month.  For now, we will
begin a dexamethasone taper 2 mg p.o. q.d. for two weeks,
then 1 mg p.o. q.d. for two weeks, then 0.5 mg p.o. for two
weeks, then 0.5 mg p.o. q.o.d. for four weeks, then off.

8. Hypoxia:  Patient was noted to have an increased O2
requirement once on the regular medical floor saturating 90%
on room air from 97% on room air.  Chest x-ray on admission
was clear, but repeat chest x-ray two days later showed a
small bilateral pleural effusion with a questionable
infiltrate in the left lower lobe.  Decision was made to
treat with Levaquin for 10 days and encouraged use of
incentive spirometer.

9. Code status:  Full.

10. Low back pain:  Chronic.  Responds well to Percocet.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Intracranial hemorrhage outside of oligoastrocytoma.
2. Brain cancer.
3. Left lower extremity cellulitis.
4. Question of pneumonia.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient is to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]
on [**3-21**].  He is also to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
two weeks.  He is also to have a followup MRI on [**3-21**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Patient is at baseline, somewhat
lethargic, but able to answer all questions.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Keppra 1500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Neurontin 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.
3. Regular insulin-sliding scale.
4. Tylenol prn.
5. Percocet prn.
6. Valproate 500 mg p.o. q.8h.
7. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Dexamethasone taper as described above.
9. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for 10 days.
10. Potassium chloride 40 mEq p.o. q.d. for three days.

 MRI/MRA BRAIN:

 HISTORY:  Rule out residual aneurysm vs. hydrocephalus.

 Sagittal short TR, short TE spin echo imaging was performed through the brain.
  Axial imaging was performed with long TR, long TE fast spin echo technique,
 FLAIR technique, and susceptibility technique.  3D TOF MRA was performed
 through the brain.  No prior brain MR examinations are available for
 comparison.  Comparison is made to head CTs performed on [**2181-10-5**] and [**2181-10-17**].


 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coiling of an intracranial aneurysm.
 There is a large area of signal void in the expected location of the anterior
 communicating artery.  Although I do not detect a patent residual lumen, the
 accurracy of MRA for detecting such a lumen in the setting of this extensive
 susceptibility artifact is quite limited.  There is faint hyperintensity along
 the margins of the coils.  This may represent a small amount of blood flow in
 a residual aneurysm.  However, this may also reflect susceptibility artifact
 at the margins.  Unfortunately, due to its proximity to the coils, MRA of this
 region will be severely limited.  Images of the remainder of the vessels
 demonstrate no abnormalities.

 Conventional imaging of the brain demonstrates scattered foci of
 hyperintensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter.  These
 findings suggest chronic small vessel ischemia.

 CONCLUSION:

 No definite residual lumen of the aneurysm noted on MRA.  However, there is
 faint hyperintensity around the margins of the aneurysm.  This might represent
 a small amount of flow in a residual portion of the aneurysm, or a
 susceptibility artifact.

platelets 264, PT was 12.5, PTT 30.2, INR 1, sodium 141,
Potassium 4.2, 113 chloride, bicarbonate 19, BUN 30,
creatinine was 1.4, glucose is 143.

EKG showed normal sinus rhythm.

Chest x-ray was pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was brought emergently to the Neuro
Angio Diagnostic Suite on [**2181-10-5**] where she underwent GDC
embolization and coiling for grade 1 ACOM aneurysm.
Postoperatively she had a decline in mental status post her
procedure requiring reintubation.  A stat head CT showed
ventriculomegaly.   A right frontal ventriculostomy.  Catheter
was placed emergently, and the patient tolerated the
procedure well.  Patient was admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit for q. one-hour neuro checks.  She was started on Kefzol
for her drain prophylaxis.  Was kept NPO.  Started on
Protonix and Nimodipine.  Her blood pressure was kept less
than 140.

On her first postoperative day on [**2181-10-6**] temperature was
96.4, heart rate 64, blood pressure was 99 to 120s/upper 30s
to 50s.  ICT was 6 to 8, CBP 54 to 76, Dilantin was 4.9.
Patient was opening eyes to voice, following commands.
Pupils were 3.5 to 3 to ambient light.  Her right femoral
site was intact with good distal pulses.  Postoperative
hematocrit was 26.5.  She was given one unit of blood and
given a 500 mg bolus of Dilantin.  She was attempted to be
weaned from the ventilator.

She was extubated on [**2181-10-7**] without problems.  She was
awake, alert, and oriented to [**Hospital6 2018**].  Pupils were 1.5 and trace reactive.  IPs were [**5-21**].

On [**2181-10-10**] patient had a temperature of 101.2.  Blood
pressures have been in the 150s to 180s, CBP 7 to 19, ICP 3
to 9.  She remained fluid negative, 1500 cc in 24-hour
period.  She remained awake, alert, and oriented times three.
Her upper and lower extremities motor strength was [**5-21**].  Her
groin site was intact without a hematoma.  She was given
fluid boluses p.r.n. and albumin 25% q. 8 hours to keep her
CBP 8 to 10.  Systolic blood pressure ranges 160 to 180, and
Nimodipine was decreased to 30 q. 4 hours.  Her drain was
increased to 15 mm above her tragus, 50 mm of water above her
tragus, and she was kept on Triple H therapy.  On [**2181-10-6**]
her drain was increased to 20 mm above and she tolerated that
well, remaining awake, alert, and oriented times three.  Her
blood pressures were in the 180 range.

On [**2181-10-12**] patient became short of breath and tachycardiac
with hypertension and having difficulty breathing.  She was
awake, alert, had bilateral wheezing.  EKG showed some
changes in V1.  Gas was 7.39, 33, 69, -321.  CK was 192.
Respiratory distress was improved with 100% non-rebreather.
Ativan was given for anxiety.  The patient still seemed
tachycardiac with sats in the 94%.  Chest x-ray was difficult
to read.  She was given some Lopressor to help blockage her
blood pressure, and she was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction.  She was given 10 mg of Lasix, which helped, and
gave her less shortness of breath.

On [**2181-10-14**] her T-max was 101.8, blood pressure 160s to
180s, CBP 8 to 22, ICP 3 to 11.  She was awake, alert,
oriented.  No further respiratory problems.  [**Name (NI) **]
ventriculostomy drain was increased to 25 mm of water above
the tragus.  She had a chest x-ray which showed bibasilar
atelectasis, bilateral pleural effusions.  She also had an
echocardiogram which showed ejection fraction of 50 to 55%,
3+ mitral valve regurgitation, and 1 to 2+ aortic
insufficiency.  Tiny anterior pericardial infusion, no
tamponade.

On [**2181-10-14**] her drain was clamped.  She was given two units
of fresh frozen plasma and one unit of packed red blood cells
for a hematocrit of 29 with an ANR of 1.4.  Cultures had all
been negative except for some yeast in her sputum for prior
temperature workups.  With her drain increased to 25 she had
a severe headache and nauseated, so that was opened at 25 and
her headache improved.

On [**2181-10-15**] her INR was 1.7.  She was given two units of
fresh frozen plasma and she was given a Dilantin bolus due to
her Dilantin level of 5.5.  Her ICPs were in 3 to 11 range.

ICPs were in the 7 to 10 range.  Drain was again attempted
to be clamped on [**2181-10-16**], and the drain was discontinued
on [**2181-10-17**].  Repeat head CT showed no increase in size of
her ventricles.  Her culture workups were negative.

On [**2181-10-18**] she was transferred to the regular Surgical
floor, where she remained awake, alert, and oriented, moving
all of her extremities, continued on Salt Tabs.  She was seen
by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy, who worked with
her for mobility, gait training, and safety evaluation.

Her central line was discontinued on [**2181-10-22**].  She was
seen by Social Work on [**2181-10-22**] after complaining of
feeling depressed.  Stated her spirits were down somewhat
because of her long hospitalization.  She was found to have
no vegetative signs.  Her ability to keep up and initiate
conversation and description of her family was supportive,
and she is just eager to return home.  Social Work followed

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old male who
presented with new shortness of breath in early [**Month (only) **] of this
year.  An echocardiogram at an outside hospital showed new
dilated cardiomyopathy.

He first noted symptoms on approximately the [**Hospital1 107**] Day
weekend.  He described his symptoms as similar to asthmatic
symptoms.  This progressed to severe orthopnea, a symptom he
had no previously had causing him to sit upright and gasp for
breath at night.  He used his friend's albuterol nebulizers
with minimal improvement.  He denies lower extremity edema.
His shortness of breath at this point was severely limiting
his activity, walking 20 to 30 feet with severe dyspnea.  He
felt better leaning forward.  He also describes decreased
appetite.

At the beginning of [**Month (only) **] he saw his primary care physician
who felt he was having an asthma exacerbation and gave him
intravenous Solu-Medrol, and the patient relayed a vague
story of going into sinus tachycardia with a heart rate in
the 120s, a fingerstick in the 500s, been sent to the
Emergency Department and admitted to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital.
A chest x-ray showed a question of a left upper lobe
pneumonia.  He was given intravenous antibiotics; ceftriaxone
and azithromycin.  He was discharged from that hospital on
[**7-7**].  An echocardiogram during that admission showed
global hypokinesis, 4-chamber dilatation, an ejection
fraction of 10% to 15%.  There were no previous
echocardiograms.

The patient denies antecedent upper respiratory infection or
recent diarrheal illness.  No rash.  No joint pains.  Denies
a history of exertional chest pain, previous orthopnea, or
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.

In the week between discharge from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital and
admission to [**Hospital1 69**] he felt
better with decreased dyspnea on exertion, increased exercise
tolerance, and decreased lower extremity edema.  His blood
pressure previously had been 130s to 190s; he would take it
at work.  His cholesterol status is unknown.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy.
2.  Moderate mitral regurgitation.
3.  Global hypokinesis.
4.  Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
5.  Elevated liver function tests.
6.  Asthma; no previous steroids.
7.  Pneumonia, status post ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Azmacort, NPH insulin 25 units
q.a.m. and 10 units q.p.m., a course of Ceftin (ended on
[**7-14**]).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives in [**Location (un) 23708**].  He has a human
immunodeficiency virus positive partner (female), positive
tobacco history times 20 years, previous heavy drinker (now
social), very remote cocaine use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   One uncle with coronary artery disease and
a sister with Grave's disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Pulse of 114, blood
pressure of 122/88, 98% on room air. In general, he was a
large man, in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat showed extraocular muscles were intact.  Pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  The oropharynx was
clear without lesions, 10 cm of jugular venous distention in
the neck.  Lungs were clear to auscultation without crackles;
however, decreased air movement was noted bilaterally.  Heart
was fourth heart sound and first heart sound and second heart
sound regular without murmurs.  The abdomen was obese.
Sacral and abdominal wall edema.  Bowel sounds were present.
It was soft.  Extremities showed 4+ edema, warm.  Neurologic
examination was nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count of 9.7, hematocrit of 39, mean cell volume of 88,
platelets of 251.  Blood urea nitrogen of 16, creatinine
of 0.8, glucose of 168.  AST of 79, ALT of 340,
thyroid-stimulating hormone of 0.9, alkaline phosphatase
of 186, albumin of 3.2, total bilirubin of 1.2.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Liver ultrasound from the outside
hospital showed fatty infiltrate, no ascites, bilateral
pleural effusions, normal portal flow.

Transthoracic echocardiogram at the outside hospital on
[**7-6**] showed dilated left atrium of 5.6 cm, dilated left
ventricle with severe global hypokinesis, ejection fraction
of 10% to 15%, moderate mitral regurgitation, dilated right
ventricle with moderate global dysfunction, mild tricuspid
regurgitation, pulmonary artery pressure in the 30s.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was noted to be in severe
heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy based on the
outside hospital records, the etiology of which was unclear.

He was sent to the catheterization laboratory which revealed
a middle left anterior descending artery lesion of 80%,
status post stent.  The right coronary artery was totally
occluded.  The left circumflex had a moderate ostial lesion
which was not intervened upon.  His pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 35 mmHg to 40 mmHg.  His cardiac index was
1.4 L/kg/min/m2.

After catheterization, the patient was taken to the Coronary
Care Unit with an intra-aortic balloon pump and was diuresed
approximately 15 liters in the Coronary Care Unit with
intravenous Lasix.  He was transferred back to the Cardiology
Service for continued diuresis.  He was started on a heart
failure regimen of captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d., Lasix 120 mg
p.o. b.i.d., Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d., carvedilol 3.125 mg
p.o. b.i.d.  He was also started on a statin, Lipitor 10 mg
p.o. q.d.

He was seen by the Electrophysiology Service for the
possibility of receiving a prophylactic automatic internal
cardioverter-defibrillator.  Given the fact that this was not
an ischemic cardiomyopathy, it was felt that it was not
indicated at this point.

2.  DIABETES:  He was continued on his diabetic regimen.

3.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  Electrolytes were
repleted on a p.r.n. basis given his aggressive ongoing
diuresis.

4.  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient remained on the
Cardiology Service as of [**7-18**].  An addendum to this
Discharge Summary will be dictated by the incoming intern.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year old
retired medical doctor who had percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty [**2184-11-24**], for coronary artery disease.
On workup, it was discovered that he had advanced T2 NO
distal esophageal gastric cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty times two, no history of myocardial
infarction.
2.  Chronic atrial fibrillation.
3.  Hypertension.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is an ex-smoker of greater than twenty
years.  He denied ethanol abuse.

ALLERGIES:  Questionable allergy to Penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, physical examination was
unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was taken to the operating room on
[**2185-1-5**], for an esophagogastrectomy using [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
approach by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], assistants Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37699**]
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], general endotracheal anesthesia.  Please see
the operative note for full details.

Postoperatively, the patient was doing well.  He had an
epidural and we were using Lopressor for rate control and he
was in the Intensive Care Unit at that time.  He was on
Vancomycin and Flagyl postoperatively.  On postoperative day
one, the patient was transferred from the Post Anesthesia
Care Unit to the floor.  Acute Pain Service was involved with
reverse pain control.

On [**2185-1-6**], at 4:00 p.m. the patient's blood pressure
dropped to 70/40 with the heart rate in the 100s.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation.  Urine output
had dropped to 15 ccs per hour since 7:00 a.m. that morning.
He was bolused.  At 2:00 a.m. on [**2185-1-7**], the patient went
to cardiac arrest and was resuscitated and was sent to the
Intensive Care Unit.  Central lines were placed and the
patient was in grave condition.

The patient's kidney function was slightly affected as he
went into some degree of renal failure with a rising
creatinine which resolved toward his discharge date.  The
patient was intubated and sedated in the unit.  On the
evening of [**2185-1-7**], the patient was extubated and was alert
and confused and was again in atrial fibrillation.  The
patient remained in the unit anticoagulated on Heparin with
chest tubes and nasogastric tube.  The patient's creatinine
at this point had decreased to 1.5 from a high of 2.2.

The patient on postoperative day five, [**2185-1-10**], had
recovered well and was transferred to the floor where rate
control was an issue.  The patient was getting tube feeds and
was NPO.  PCA was discontinued.  Foley was discontinued and
central line was discontinued on [**2185-1-12**].

On [**2185-1-12**], it was noted that the patient's white count had
increased and his back wound was dehiscing.  The middle third
was opened and drainage came out.  He was packed with gauze.
The patient was continued on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and
Flagyl.  The patient was confused and a Code Purple was
declared on [**2185-1-13**], and psychiatry was involved.  His
Haldol was changed and adjusted.  Heparin was discontinued on
the patient on [**2185-1-13**], and Coumadin was begun since his INR
was now therapeutic.  For the rest of the stay and
postoperative day number nine, we continued the antibiotics.
His chest tube was put to water seal.  The patient's chest
tube was removed.  On [**2185-1-15**], inferior aspect of the
abdominal wound was showing some drainage and the patient's
diet was being advanced and we continued wet to dry dressings
at this point.  However, the patient was then made NPO.  The
patient's tube feeds continued.

CAT scan was done on the patient and showed question of a
leak.  On [**2185-1-18**], the CT scan questioned a leak, however,
no direct leak was seen as some retromediastinal and
supradiaphragmatic air and debris was seen.  The patient had
a nasogastric tube placed by fluoroscopy on 0/25/02, and
nutrition was once again involved as he was made NPO as
previously stated.  Electrolytes were repleted.

The patient's INR was continuously adjusted to be 2.0 to 2.5
and Lovenox was temporarily used for two days until for a
moment when his INR dropped below 2.0.  At the patient's
behest, a medical consultation was called on [**2185-1-19**], with
regard to controlling his atrial fibrillation.  An
echocardiogram was done to check his left ventricular
function and right ventricular function which came back
normal.  We continued Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Barium swallow CT was done on [**2185-1-21**], which showed the
question of a leak as well.  However, no direct leak was
seen.

The patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells
to adjust for hematocrit which had fallen to 22.0 range and
Lopressor was changed to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. in an attempt to
control his atrial fibrillation.  During this time of
admission on [**2185-1-22**], and onward, we were using Lasix to
help diurese the patient.  The patient was complaining of
edema and was noted to be puffy and likely fluid overloaded.

The patient had an episode of ventricular tachycardia on
[**2185-1-25**], which was nonsustained and seven beats long and a
cardiology electrophysiology consultation was called.  They
suggested increasing his Lopressor and discontinuing the
Diltiazem which we did.  They suggested a blood transfusion,
discontinuing Diltiazem and Lopressor to be 100 mg t.i.d.
which we did.  The patient's nasogastric tube was
discontinued on [**2185-1-26**], had a CT scan which showed unlikely
to be a current leak since no communication was seen between
the collections and esophageal and gastric anastomosis.  The
patient was allowed to have a clear liquid diet which he
tolerated.

Discharge summary addendum to follow.

                                 FINAL REPORT






 INDICATION:  Left obstructive ureterovesicular junction stone status post left
 nephroureteral stent [**10-7**].  Perform antegrade nephrostogram for possible
 removal of the left nephrostomy tube.

 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 451**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 24584**] Dr.
 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2091**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27**], the staff radiologist, present and supervising throughout.  The
 risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient and
 informed written consent was obtained. Preprocedure time-out was performed to
 confirm the patient's identity and the procedure to undertaken.  The patient
 was placed prone on the angiography table.  Her left flank was prepped and
 draped in the usual sterile fashion.

 An antegrade nephrostogram was performed via the patient's existing 8 FR
 internal-external nephroureteral stent which demonstrated the appropriate
 position of the catheter.  The existing stent was cut to remove the pigtail.
 An attempt was made to pass a 0.035 Bentson guidewire through the existing
 stent, however, this was unsuccessful. A stiff glidewire was then advanced
 through the existing nephroureteral stent into the bladder.  The existing
 stent was removed. Subsequently, a 7 FR sheath was advanced over the glidewire
 with tip placed in the mid ureter. A repeat antegrade nephroureterogram was
 performed which demonstrated contrast flowing freely through the distal
 ureter, ureterovesicular junction, and bladder without evidence of filling
 defects or obstruction. The sheath was then withdrawn slightly and placed
 within the renal pelvis. A subsequent nephrogram showed hydronephrosis and
 obstruction at the ureteropelvic junction with filling defects likely
 representing stones. An 8 FR, 24 cm, internal/external nephroureteral stent
 was then placed over the wire with pigtails formed and locked within the left
 renal pelvis and within the bladder.  The catheter was secured to the skin
 using #0-silk suture. A Statlock device was applied followed by a dry sterile
                                                             (Over)

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old woman with L obstructive UVJ stone, renal failure,
and urosepisis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please place nephrostomy tube
HISTORY: A 75-year-old female with urosepsis, ureteral stone,
and need for decompression of the renal collecting system.

PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the staff radiologist,
was present and supervising throughout. After the risks and
benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient and
informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed prone on
the angiography table. Her left flank was prepped and draped in
the standard sterile fashion. 400 mg of intravenous
Ciprofloxicin was administered. The skin and subcutaneous
tissues in the left flank region were anesthetized with 10 cc of
1% Lidocaine. Using ultrasound guidance, attempts were made to
advance a 22-gauge Chiba needle into a posterior lower pole
calyx. After several attempts, however, this proved
unsuccessful. The patient was then given 40 cc of 60% Optiray
intravenously. Using fluoroscopy, a new 22-gauge Chiba needle
was advanced through an anesthetized region in the left flank
into an opacified middle pole calyx. After the stylet was
removed, urine was aspirated confirming our position within the
renal collecting system. The urine sample was sent for culture.

An antegrade nephrostogram was then performed via hand injection
of nonionic contrast. This revealed a mildly dilated collecting
system with complete obstruction identified at the level of the
distal ureter. A .018 guide wire was advanced through the Chiba
needle into the proximal ureter under fluoroscopic
visualization. The skin entry site was incised with a #11 blade
scalpel. The access needle was exchanged for a 6-French
Accustick sheath with inner dilator and metallic stiffener. Upon
entry into the renal parenchyma, the metallic stiffener was
removed. The Accustick sheath and inner dilator were advanced
over the wire until the tip was positioned in the proximal
ureter. The guide wire and inner dilator were removed. A .035
[**Last Name (un) 33107**] wire was then advanced through the Accustick sheath into
the distal ureter. The [**Last Name (un) 33107**] wire could not be advanced beyond
the area of obstruction into the bladder. At this time, the
Accustick sheath was exchanged for a 6-French 23 cm bright-tip
angiographic sheath. With the sheath tip positioned in the
proximal ureter, a 5-French Kumpe catheter was advanced through
the angiographic sheath into the distal ureter. Using the
[**Last Name (un) 33107**] wire, attempts were made to traverse the area of
obstruction. Again, this was unsuccessful and the [**Last Name (un) 33107**] wire
was exchanged for a .035 angled glidewire.

Using this wire, in combination with the 5-French Kumpe
catheter, the area of obstruction was successfully passed. With
the glidewire positioned in the bladder, beyond the area of
obstruction, the Kumpe catheter was exchanged for a 5-French
vertebral catheter. The glidewire was then exchanged for a .035
super-stiff Amplatz wire. At this time, the vertebral catheter
and 6-French angiographic sheath were removed. An 8-French 24 cm
internal/external nephroureteral stent was then advanced over
the Amplatz wire into the bladder. The super-stiff Amplatz wire
was removed. The catheter pigtails were formed and locked in the
bladder and in the right renal pelvis. A hand injection of
nonionic contrast confirmed the appropriate positioning of the
nephroureteral stent. The catheter was secured to the skin using
a #0 silk suture. A Stat- Lock device was applied, followed by a
dry sterile dressing. The catheter was placed to external bag
drainage and may be capped in approximately 24 hours.
COMPLICATIONS: None.
MEDICATIONS: 1% Lidocaine. 400 mg intravenous Ciprofloxicin. 2
mg of Versed and 100 mcg of Fentanyl were administered in
intermittent doses with continuous monitoring of vital signs by
the nursing staff.
CONTRAST: 90 cc of 60% Optiray.
IMPRESSION:
1. Antegrade nephrostogram revealed mild left hydronephrosis
with a complete obstruction identified at the level of the
distal ureter, secondary to stone presence.
2. Successful placement of a 24 cm 8 French internal/external
nephroureteral stent via a left posterior middle pole calyx. The
catheter has side holes extending throughout its length and was
placed to external bag drainage. The catheter may be capped for
internal drainage in approximately 24 hours.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old female with right staghorn calculi for >20 years and
new left obstructing calculi with hydronephrosis, ureteral
dilation and perinephric stranding associated with increasedd
WBC count, tachycardia, hypotension refractory to fluids and
increased creatinine.
.
1.  Sepsis: Although pt has no fever and no tachypnea, pt does
have an elevated white count, with tachycardia as well as a
positive UA suggesting pylonephritis and urosepsis.
.
A).  Source was most likely urosepsis with positive UA, and
obstructing stone by CT scan.  She was treated with broad
spectrum antibiotics with cefepime and cipro.  Urology was
already consulted as was IR. A percutaneous nephrostomy tube was
placed [**10-22**] by IR  with resultant good urine output.
.
B).  Hemodynamics:  Pt had hypotension temporarily requiring
pressors and IVF to bring up CVP. Pressors were successfully
weaned.  She had been  mentating appropriately suggesting mental
status would be an appropriate measure.
.
2.  Acute Renal Failure: It was  secondary to obstructive stone
lesion (pt already with atrophic R kidney, now presenting with
obstructive lesion in L kidney).  No history of renal
insufficiency as per patient.  The percutaneous nephrostomy tube
was placed and the patient's creatinine improved with fluid
hydration.
.
3.  Anemia of chronic decrease with decreased hematocrit over
past 9 months (HCT 36 in [**1-6**])plus possible blood loss from
nephrostomy stent placement and IVF this admission. The patient
has a history of colon cancer with a normal colonoscopy last
year.  Iron studies were normal and the patient was guaiac
negative.
.
4.  Hypertension was controlled on metoprolol.
.
The patient was discharged in good condition with follow up in
urology clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9125**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]. She was restarted on
prophylactic amoxicillin as an outpatient.

Patient was seen emergently in the ED and was taken to the OR
for a craniotomy. Postop, patient had no eye opening. Moves
left upper and lower extremities spontaneously and
purposefully with right-sided hemiparesis. Pupils equal and
brisk. Not following commands. Exam on 15 mg of propofol.
Patient was kept with a SBP of less than 120 and q.1h. neuro
checks with repeat head CT in the morning.

Patient had a repeat head CT on [**4-18**] that showed no change
in the large left intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated
subfalcine herniation and minimal uncal herniation.

On [**2160-4-23**], the patient underwent tracheostomy and PEG
without complication. The patient remained in the ICU until
[**4-24**] when he was transferred to the step-down unit.
Neurologically, he remained unchanged, occasionally opening
his eyes. Purposeful on the left side, hemiparesis on the
right side.

In the neuro step-down, he remained neurologically unchanged.
He had a LP done on [**4-24**] that showed an opening pressure of
27, closing pressure of 14. Twenty cc of CSF was sent. He had
a repeat LP done the following day with an opening pressure
of 32, closing pressure was not recorded. He was seen by the
ID service for a question of meningitis. He also had climbing
LFTs. General surgery was consulted. They recommended getting
a right upper quadrant ultrasound which was done and was read
as negative.

GI was consulted for the elevated LFTs. They felt they were
maybe related to his ceftazidime that he was getting for his
MRSA and urine infection. That was discontinued, and the
patient was kept on vancomycin for MRSA in his sputum and
blood. His LFTs came down slowly. He should have them checked
every week. He also will need to be restarted on Coumadin for
his heart valve. Head CT is pending for [**2160-5-2**]. The
results will decide when he will start on his Coumadin.

He was seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy, and
he will require an acute rehab stay. He will remain on
vancomycin for a total of 14 days. Vancomycin should continue
until [**2160-5-9**]. He is on 1000 mg IV q.8. Other
medications: Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., hold for heart

This report will cover the patient's stay through [**2188-10-20**].


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63 year old male with
a history of hypertension and colon cancer status post
hemicolectomy who is status post a nine foot fall from the
cab of his truck on [**2188-10-2**].  The patient was reportedly
down for about two hours before help arrived and has had
changes in mental status since his fall.  He was originally
seen at the [**Hospital 1558**] Hospital where he was
admitted and found to have a left scalp abrasion that was
sutured, a left clavicle fracture, left rib fractures and a
head CT scan that did not show any evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage.  His next CT scan was also negative for fracture.
The pain was controlled there with percocet and he was
cleared by Physical Therapy for discharge home with a
creatinine of 2.4 at discharge.  At home, however, he was
unable to carry out his activities of daily living, became
short of breath and was brought to an outside hospital
Emergency Room where his CK was noted to be 2456 and he was
noted to have a troponin T of 2.4, creatinine of 3.5, and had
an O2 saturation of only 81% on five liters nasal cannula.

An echocardiogram was carried out which showed an ejection
fraction of 40 to 45% and an arterial blood gas at the
outside hospital showed a pH of 7.32, with pCO2 of 48 and a
pO2 of 50.  A chest CT scan demonstrated right upper lobe and
right lower lobe consolidation consistent with
bronchopulmonary pneumonia thought to be secondary to
aspiration pneumonia.  No pneumothorax was seen.  Again, a
head CT scan was negative.  Given the patient's white blood
cell count elevation, infiltrate and hypoxia, he was given
one gram of ceftriaxone, aspirin for positive cardiac enzymes
and morphine sulfate for pain and was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further care.

On admission to the [**Hospital1 69**], the
patient was alert and intermittently oriented.  The patient
received in the Emergency Department aspirin, Flagyl and
further morphine sulfate for pain.  The patient was noted to
have unequal blood pressures in his arms and a transthoracic
echocardiogram was carried out to rule out dissection.

The transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated no evidence of
aortic or thoracic dissection and showed mile regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with posterior and apical
hypokinesis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension times three years.
2.  Colon cancer status post hemicolectomy in [**2175**].
3.  Prostate cancer status post prostatectomy.
4.  Remote history of Hepatitis B approximately 25 years ago.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Accupril 40 mg q. day.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone; he is separated
from his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has two supportive daughters.  [**Name (NI) **] has
smoked approximately two to three packs per day times 50
years.  Has occasional ethanol.  Denies any intravenous drug
use.  He is a trucker and was independent before his fall.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs with
temperature of 98.0 F.; blood pressure 122/65; pulse 102;
respiratory rate 20; O2 saturation 84% on room air and
increased to 97 to 100% on a nonrebreather.  In general, the
patient was found lying in bed guarding his left side in mild
distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equally round and reactive to
light.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Oropharynx is clear.
The patient wears dentures.  Neck with no lymphadenopathy.
Chest with diffuse rales and rhonchi on the right; clearer on
the left but dullness is present at the left base.
Ecchymoses are present over the left anterior chest wall and
he is tender to palpation on the left side of his chest.
Abdomen soft, nontender, slightly distended, positive bowel
sounds.  Midline well healed scar.  Extremities with no
edema, clubbing or cyanosis.  Two plus dorsalis pedis and
radial pulses bilaterally.  Neurological examination:  The
patient is awake, oriented to person, occasionally to place,
occasionally to time.  Cranial nerves II through XII are
intact. Strength is five plus in all regions.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 22.1,
hematocrit 40.5, platelets 298.  Sodium 138, potassium 5.2,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 24, BUN 41, creatinine 3.4 and
glucose is 117.  CK is 2427, with an MB of 133 and a troponin
T of 3.41.

EKG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with normal axis and
intervals and chamber size.  There are no ST or T wave
changes.

Chest x-ray demonstrates minimally displaced rib fractures
within the fifth, sixth and seventh left ribs posteriorly as
well as a depressed fracture of the left clavicle which is
displaced inferiorly by the width of the bone.  There is no
pneumothorax.  Mild congestive heart failure is evidenced by
vascular engorgement.  Lungs are otherwise clear.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was begun on
antibiotics for presumed aspiration pneumonia and was placed
on aspirin, beta blockers, given the elevated cardiac enzymes
on admission.  The patient's O2 saturations initially
stabilized on therapy for presumed aspiration pneumonia and
the patient was transferred to the Floor.

However, on the day of transfer, the patient had a further
episode of hypoxia and hypotension with a drop in his
systolic blood pressure to the 80s.  The patient was bolused
with a total of two liters of normal saline with improvement
of his systolic blood pressure to 100 to 105 and the patient
was transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
further management.

On readmission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he had an
O2 saturation of 80% on six liters via nasal cannula.  He was
transferred to a 50% face mask where his arterial blood gas
was found to be 7.34/44/55.  The patient demonstrated
increasing agitation and required 50 mg of Haldol for
sedation.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1.  PULMONARY:  The patient's hypoxia was most likely
secondary to aspiration pneumonia as well as fluid overload.
He was diuresed with intravenous Lasix with improvement of
his respiration.  He was continued on a 14 day course of
Levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
The patient's respirations further improved with chest PT and
he was transitioned back to nasal cannula and finally room
air.  The patient was able to maintain adequate room air O2
saturations.

2.  CARDIAC:  The patient was noted to have nonspecific
inferior ST depressions with T wave inversions, that were 1
mm in V4 through V6 in the setting of sinus tachycardia.  On
another occasion, the patient was noted to have T wave
inversions in III and AVF with 1/[**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions in V4
and V5.  On a further occasion, the patient was noted again
in the setting of sinus tachycardia to have [**Street Address(2) 1766**]
depressions in V4 through V6.

The patient was monitored on Telemetry and was noted to
undergo atrial fibrillation at a rate of 140 on the [**10-10**] with V4 through V6 ST depressions of 1 mm.  Telemetry
demonstrated further intermittent episodes of atrial
fibrillation with rates up to 160 and a possible ten beat run
of Ventricular tachycardia.  Transesophageal echocardiogram
demonstrated trace mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid
regurgitation, mildly depressed ejection fraction with
posterior / apical hypokinesis and no evidence of dissection.
Furthermore, the transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated
left ventricular hypertrophy with mild global hypokinesis.

The patient's CK was 2427 on admission and peaked at 2551 on
the [**10-8**], after which point it trended downward to
575 on the [**10-13**].  His CK MB was 133 on admission
and declined consistently throughout his hospitalization.
His CK MB was 5 on the [**10-13**].

His troponin T was 3.41 on admission and increased to a
maximum of 5.22 on the [**10-12**].  His elevated cardiac
enzymes were thought to be primarily due to renal failure in
the setting of rhabdomyolysis as well as demand ischemia in
the setting of tachycardia.  The patient was begun on high
dose beta blocker for rate control of his atrial fibrillation
and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  He was begun also
on aspirin.  He was anti-coagulated with heparin for
prophylaxis of his atrial fibrillation.

Persantine MIBI was carried out on the [**10-15**] and
did not demonstrate any significant ischemic ST segment
changes.  There was no evidence of fixed or perfusion defects
on nuclear study.  Diffuse hypokinesis and depressed ejection
fraction of approximately 30% was noted.  The patient was
initially taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on
the [**10-23**], but was unable to undergo the procedure
at that time secondary to mental status changes and the
cardiac catheterization was deferred to a later date.

The patient was noted to have intermittent episodes of
hypotension during subsequent hospitalization and his beta
blockers and ACE inhibitor doses were titrated.

3.  RENAL:  The patient was noted to have an elevated
creatinine of 3.4 on admission.  It was difficult to
ascertain the patient's baseline creatinine level as he is
not per report had blood work done recently prior to this
admission; however, on admission to the [**Hospital 28978**] Hospital, shortly after his fall, he was noted
to have an elevated creatinine of 2.6.  His creatinine
steadily declined during the course of his hospitalization
from the maximum of 3.4 on admission to a baseline of between
2.2 and 2.4.  Renal ultrasound was carried out on the [**10-7**] and revealed diffusely increased echogenicity of the
renal parenchyma bilaterally consistent with chronic
parenchymal disease.  The left kidney is atrophied.  Overall,
the study was consistent with arterial vascular disease.  No
hydronephrosis or proximal hydroureter was seen on the study.

4.  PSYCHIATRIC:  The patient was noted to have intermittent
episodes of delirium.  A psychiatric  consultation was
obtained.  A neurological consultation was also obtained.
The patient's change in mental status were characterized by
confusion that appeared to have a temporal component to it,
with confusion occurring at its greatest at night time.  At
times, the patient was noted to have paranoid delusions.

However, he never demonstrated any clear auditory or visual
hallucinations.  He required intermittent Haldol for
sedation.  An ammonia level was checked and was found to be
27.  A CT scan of the head was obtained and did not
demonstrate any evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.  The
patient's mental status was significant improved on the [**10-20**] and at the time of this dictation, the patient is
alert and oriented times three and had a normal mini-mental
status examination.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient was found to be significantly
hypothyroid.  He had a TSH of 38 on the [**10-10**].
Repeat TSH on the 19th revealed a level of 45.  The patient
was begun on Levothyroxine at 12.5 micrograms per day.  His
repeat TSH and thyroid studies will be carried out four weeks
after this was initiated.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
male with no prior cardiac history who originally presented
to his primary care physician because of an upper respiratory
infection.  During the examination, he was noted to have a
murmur and was referred to a cardiologist for further
evaluation.  An echocardiogram was done in [**2126-7-25**].
The echocardiogram revealed preserved LV function with left
ventricular hypertrophy, severe aortic stenosis with a
P-gradient of 90, aortic valve area of 0.8.  There was
pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary systolic pressure of
40, moderate mitral regurgitation and left atrial
enlargement.  The patient denied any chest pain, shortness of
breath or dizziness.  However, according to his wife, she did
notice him to be short of breath with moderate level of
activity.  The patient was consequently referred to cardiac
catheterization for further evaluation.  The patient denied
any claudication, orthopnea, edema, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea or lightheadedness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Recent upper respiratory infection
treated with antibiotic.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg po q day
2.  Multivitamins 1 tablet q day

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  Hematocrit 39.7, white blood cell
count 9.9, platelets 212.  INR 1.2, glucose 132, potassium
4.6.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Prior to admission, the patient
had a cardiac catheterization performed.  Cardiac
catheterization showed left ventricular ejection fraction of
49%.  It also revealed mild pulmonary hypertension, severe
central aortic hypertension with moderately increased
ventricular filling pressure and mild mitral regurgitation.
The patient was admitted to cardiac surgery for a possible
surgical intervention.

On [**2126-9-30**], the patient underwent aortic valve replacement
(minimally invasive) for his aortic stenosis.  Postoperative
echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of
more than 55%.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.
There were no complications.  Please see the full operative
note for additional detail.  The patient was transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.  The patient
remained intubated.  The patient was in sinus rhythm while in
the Intensive Care Unit.  He remained afebrile with stable
blood pressures and heart rate.  He was maintained on Lasix,
aspirin and Lopressor.  He was extubated on postoperative day
1.  The patient was then transferred to the floor in stable
condition.

While on the floor, the patient was thought to be slightly
confused.  Given a history of alcohol use, his symptoms and
signs were carefully monitored.  On postoperative day 2, the
patient experienced atrial fibrillation with heart rate in
the 140s.  The patient was treated with IV Lopressor.  In
addition, the patient was maintained on po Lopressor dose.
The patient converted to sinus rhythm on the next
postoperative day, remained in sinus rhythm up until his
discharge.  His pacer wires were removed on postoperative day
2.  Physical therapy was following the patient throughout his
hospitalization.  He was cleared to go home without any
additional services needed.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Femoral catheterization and successful recanalization, PTA,
cryoplasty and stenting of the left
SFA


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 71 yo F with h/o porcine AVR, CABG (LIMA->LAD), PVD
presenting for elective angioplasty of Left SFA lesion.
Previously, she was found by her cardiologist, to have a R ABI
of 0.59 and a left ABI of 0.5 after complaining of BL
claudication.  She presented for elective angiography and PCI of
the left and was to return in 2 weeks for treatment of the R.
This AM, angiography revealed a Left distal SFA lesion with
diffuse disease to the proximal popliteal and proximal occlusion
of the AT and PT with reconstitution distally from collaterals.
She received angioplasty, cryoplasty and stenting of the left
SFA lesion from Right femoral artery access.  Her sheath was
subsequently removed at 11 AM with minor oozing at the site of
the wound.  An ACT at the time was found to be 220, an EKG
showed NSR with frequent PACs but no acute changes from prior to
procedure.  Pressure was held for 30 minutes by the
interventional fellow with attainment of hemostasis.  30 minutes
later, the patient felt wet, and noticed bleeding at the site of
the wound.  Pressure was again held at the site of the wound for
30 minutes.  While holding pressure, she became persistently
hypotensive HR 40s, SBP 60s.  1 amp of atropine was given and
dopamine was given transiently.  She became tachycardic to the
130s and developed [**11-23**] sharp pain below her breasts R>L
without radiation associated with nausea (no SOB, diaphoresis).
She denied having felt this pain before.  She was given wide
open fluids x 2 L, a hct was checked and found to be 33 (from
her baseline of 40), and she was given a bolus of 1 unit of
blood.  Her BP stabilized at 103/49 and her HR decreased to 104.
 Her temp was 94, likely due to the IVF, and she was given warm
blankets.  Her RUQ abdominal/chest pain gradually resolved and
she was subsequently transferred to the CCU.  In the CCU, she
reported resolution of her CP.  No back pain.

**PTCA RESULTS


PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiography showed a distally
occluded left
SFA. We planned to recanalize the vessel. Heparin was used for
anticoagulation. A 7 French [**Last Name (un) 12297**] sheath was advanced around the
[**Doctor Last Name 534**]
into the left SFA. The lesion was crossed with an angled
GlideWire which
was then exchanged for a FilterWire. The lesion was dilated with
a
4.0x80 mm Amphirion balloon at 2-4 atm. Next, the lesion was
treated
with Cryoplasty using a 5.0x60 mm Polar catheter for multiple
inflations. Angiography showed a residual dissection which was
covered
with a 6.0x56 mm Dynalink stent, post-dilated with a 5.0x40 mm
Submarine
balloon at 8 atm. Final angiography showed a 20% residual
stenosis, no
dissection and normal flow. The patient left the lab in stable
condition.

[**2134-4-16**] Femoral Vascular Ultrasound
REPORT: There is normal flow on color flow from the right common
femoral vein and artery. No evidence of hematoma, pseudoaneurysm
or AV fistula is identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo F with h/o porcine AVR, CABG (LIMA->LAD), PVD s/p PCI of
Left distal SFA lesion complicated by R groin bleed/hematoma
with hct drop of 7.
.
#. Hct drop with groin bleed - Patient with rapid hct drop of 7
from 40 to 33 in the setting of R groin bleed and development of
hematoma.  Received 2 L of NS and 2 units of blood, and was
hemodynamically stable on transfer to the MICU.  Her metoprolol
and digoxin were held.  No evidence of RP bleed.  A right
femoral ultrasound showed no evidence of hematoma,
pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.  Her hematocrit remained stable
and there was no evidence of repeat bleeding with serial exams.
She was restarted on her metoprolol XL 25 mg QD and tolerated it
well.  Her digoxin was held as her heart rate was well
controlled and she had no evidence of heart failure.
.
#. Chest/RUQ and epigastric Abdominal pain (burning) with
nausea- this was in the setting of the dopamine drip and hct
drop and may have been demand ischemia, though her cardiac
enzymes were flat x 3 and there were no EKG changes.  She was
given protonix, maalox, anzemet and tums, and the pain resolved.

- start on omeprazole 40 QD
.
#. PVD - Following her intervention, her distal pulses remained
dopplerable bilaterally.  She is scheduled to return in [**3-20**]
weeks for angiography and possible intervention in her RLE.
- continue ASA and plavix indefinitely
.
#. Ischemia - patient s/p CABG (LIMA-> LAD 10 years ago).  No
recent cath.  No EKG changes with her chest/abdominal pain.  Her
cardiac enzymes were cycled and were flat x 3.
- continue ASA and plavix indefinitely
- restart metoprolol XL 25 mg QD
.
#. Pump - last TTE in [**10-18**] showed LVEF 60%, 1+ AR with porcine
valve, 2+ MR and 2+ TR, and evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
- continue metoprolol 25 mg PO QD
- hold digoxin with no evidence of failure and well-controlled
heart rate
.
#. Rhythm - SR, occasional PACs on telemetry

Chief Complaint:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman who had undergone an x-ray
for shoulder pain that had disclosed bilateral lung
abnormalities.  A CT scan was performed and confirmed a solid
nodule in the superior segment of her left lower lobe highly
suspicious for malignancy as well as a bulla in the right lower
lobe with a thickened cyst wall also concerning for malignancy.

A PET scan was performed subsequent to the CT scan.  This showed

that the left lower lobe nodule showed an SUV of 16.4 as well as

a left hilar node with an uptake of 9.6.  The lesion in the
right lower lobe showed an SUV of 7.5, also suspicious for
malignancy.
There was no other site of FDG avidity on the study.  She also
underwent an MRI scan on [**2142-5-24**], that was negative for
metastatic disease.  In addition, a PFT was performed in [**Month (only) **]
[**2141**] disclosing FEV1 of 133% of predicted and a diffusion
capacity of 82% of predicted.

Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed a mediastinoscopy as well as bronchial
brushing on
[**2142-5-24**].  The mediastinoscopy was negative for carcinoma.
The bronchial brushing of the left lower lobe superior segment
was also negative.
The lesions in her right lower and left lower lobe are likely to

represent
synchronous primary lung cancers rather than stage IV disease
based upon a negative mediastinoscopy and no signs of metastatic

disease on her PET/CT scan.  As a result, on [**2142-6-11**], a Left
VATS converted to a left anterior thoracotomy, a resection of
superior segment of the left lower lobe, and a mediastinal lymph

node dissection were all performed. A right lower lobectomy is
actively being considered as a future treatment option.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 68 year old Female who on [**6-11**] had a Left VATS
converted to left anterior thoracotomy, a resection of superior
segment of the left lower lobe, and a mediastinal lymph node
dissection. She developed postoperative Atrial Fibrillation with
a rapid ventricular rate soon afterwards and her blood pressure
was initially 80/40, leading to a transfer to the intensive care
unit. By [**6-14**], the patient had rate stabilized at around 110-120
and her pressures was around 109/47. Amiodarone had begun being
loaded as per cardiology recommendations and so it was felt, Ms.

[**Known lastname **] could be transferred to the floor. After coming to the
floor, Ms. [**Known lastname **] gradually improved clinically though with
persistence of her atrial fibrillation. As per Cardiology
recommendations, on [**6-15**] an initial dose of Warfarin was given
along with Heparin anticoagulation. On [**2142-6-17**], she developed
rapid A Fib into the 130s. Her lopressor was increased to 37.5
[**Hospital1 **] which she converted to sinus rhythm. Cardiology was
reconsulted and felt she had tachy-brady syndrome, and
recommended she be discharged home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor

Service:  O-MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 30 year old
male with a past medical history of pulmonic stenosis (now
thought to be secondary to an anterior mediastinal mass), who
presented with five weeks of progressive nonproductive cough,
fever, and night sweats to an outside hospital on [**2168-1-1**],
where a chest x-ray revealed an anterior mediastinal mass and
a CAT scan showed the mass measuring at 11.3 by 14.4 by 12.0
centimeters, as well as small effusions.  The patient was
sent home with follow-up but over the weekend, he developed
pleuritic left sided chest pain with mild shortness of
breath. Again, he was evaluated at the outside hospital where
the pericardial effusion now appeared large.  He was
therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
where an echocardiogram revealed a 3.5 centimeter effusion
with inferior vena cava inspiratory collapse and mitral
inflow variability without increased jugular venous pressure
or a pulsus.  The patient was transferred to the CCU for
close monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hernia repair at eight years old.
2.  Lyme disease at ten years old.
3.  Pulmonic stenosis diagnosed in [**9-11**], after a murmur and
diagnosed by echocardiogram.
4.  Shingles.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  Negative tobacco.
Three drinks of alcohol per month.  The patient works as
industrial designer, physically active.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother passed seven years ago from breast
cancer.  Grandfather with prostate carcinoma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature 101.8,
heart rate 105, blood pressure 130/70, respiratory rate 27 to
32, oxygen saturation 98% in room air.  The patient is a well
developed male who is thin and diaphoretic, anxious, in mild
respiratory distress.  The pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.   Extraocular movements
are intact.  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  The
oropharynx is clear.  Negative anterior posterior
lymphadenopathy.  Neck is supple, negative axillary nodes.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart was
tachycardia, regular S1 and S2 with II to III/VI murmur at
the left sternal border.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities
were no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  No rashes.  Strength
was [**4-13**] in all four extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
10.9, hematocrit 37.2, platelet count 381,000.  INR 1.5.
Chem7 was within normal limits.

Echocardiogram revealed normal systolic function, 3.5
effusion at the largest diameter, inferior vena cava collapse
with inspiration, question of pericardial studding, mild
respiratory variation in mitral inflow consistent with some
early signs of tamponade.  CAT scan from [**2168-1-1**],
heterogeneous mass in the left midline compressing the left
pulmonary artery, right upper lobe pleural nodules, left
pleural effusion, pericardial effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pericardial effusion at admission - The patient had signs
for early tamponade physiology but was hemodynamically stable
and was admitted to the CCU for close monitoring.  Repeat
echocardiogram showed increasing size of the effusion.  The
patient therefore underwent pericardial drain and 600cc of
grossly hemorrhagic fluid were removed.  Following the
procedure overnight, there was no further drainage from the
pericardial drain.  Repeat echocardiogram showed decreasing
pericardial fluid.  Therefore on [**2168-1-8**], the pericardial
drain was pulled.  The patient had one further follow-up
echocardiogram on [**2168-1-11**].  This revealed no effusion and it
was felt the patient was stable from a cardiac standpoint.

2.  Hematology/Oncology - The patient underwent a mediastinal
biopsy to diagnose the large anterior mediastinal mass. The
biopsy revealed nonseminomatous germ cell yoke sac tumor.
The patient underwent two treatments of radiation therapy as
well as a round of five days of chemotherapy with Etoposide
and Cisplatin.  Staging workup included a head magnetic
resonance scan which revealed no lesions, as well as an
ultrasound of the scrotum which was within normal limits.
Fluid drained from the pericardial and pleural effusions were
negative for malignant cells.  The patient tolerated
chemotherapy well suffering from nausea, relieved by Ativan.
He was pretreated with Allopurinol and intravenous fluids to
prevent tumor lysis.  The patient completed his five days of
chemotherapy.  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week
for continuation of his therapy with the possible addition of
Bleomycin following pulmonary function tests.

3.  Infection - During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, he
continued to have shortness of breath as well as a cough with
mild hemoptysis.  On [**2168-1-7**], the patient spiked a fever.
This was thought most likely secondary to the tumor burden,
however, the patient was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin
and Clindamycin as broad spectrum therapy with a question of
postobstructive pneumonia.  Subsequently, the patient did
well with no further fevers.  Vancomycin and Clindamycin were
stopped and the patient will complete a ten day course of
Levofloxacin.

4.  Pleural effusion - The patient had a left sided chest
tube placed for drainage of pleural fluid. Following the
removal of the chest tube, the patient had continued drainage
from the site of the tube.  After a number of days, this
slowly resolved.  The patient's site was closed by CT surgery
with a suture.  The suture is to be removed in seven to ten
days at a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home with VNA services for
dressing changes.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up on [**2168-1-21**], with Dr.

cardiology.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Ativan 0.5 to 1 mg p.o. q3-4hours p.r.n. nausea.
2.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. once daily times three days.
3.  Robitussin with Codeine p.r.n.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1,  Nonseminomatous germ cell anterior mediastinal tumor.
2.  Pericardial effusion, status post drainage.
3.  Left pleural effusion, status post drainage.
4.  Postobstructive pneumonia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, peripheral vascular disease, and a history of a left
lung nodule admitted from an outside hospital Intensive Care
Unit ([**Hospital3 **]) with hypotension, fever, and recurrent
pneumonia.

In brief, the patient has a long history of recurrent
bronchitis and periodic episodes of pneumonia.  She was
admitted to an outside hospital approximately a few week
prior to the current presentation with pneumonia and was
treated with an unknown antibiotic.  Unfortunately, she
returned to the outside hospital's Emergency Department on
[**1-13**] with fever, rigors, dizziness, and weakness.
When her blood pressure could not be obtained in her upper
extremities, she was started on dopamine and transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit and underwent a CT of the abdomen to
rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm, which was negative.
Chest x-ray revealed right lower lobe pneumonia, and the
patient was placed on vancomycin, gentamicin, and Zosyn.
Additionally, chest x-ray showed left lung nodule (old) and
right hilar mass.  She was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] medical intensive care unit
on [**1-15**] on dopamine.

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 69**] her
blood pressure (via the right thigh cuff) was 127/60, whereas
arm pressures were considerably lower at 60/20 in right arm
and 40/20 in the left arm.  Arm pressures were though
secondary to subclavian disease, and dopamine was
successfully weaned based on thigh blood pressures.
Antibiotics were changed from vancomycin, gentamicin, and
Zosyn to levofloxacin and Flagyl.  The patient has been
saturating well on nasal cannula oxygen while in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  Chest CT scheduled to further evaluate
left lung nodule and right hilar mass.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic smoker
with recurrent bronchitis and pneumonia times five in the
last 10 years.
2.  Peripheral vascular disease, bilateral subclavian
stenosis, bilateral carotid disease (50% on the right and 80%
on the left), arm claudication.  Negative cardiac
catheterization in [**2118**].
3.  Left lung nodule (about 4 cm).
4.  Cluster headaches times 18 years.
5.  Hyperlipidemia.
6.  Glaucoma.
7.  Status post partial hysterectomy.

ALLERGIES:  IODINE (anaphylaxis).

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Medications in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] included
enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., prednisone 40 mg
p.o. q.d., albuterol meter-dosed inhaler, Atrovent
meter-dosed inhaler, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor,
levofloxacin, and Flagyl.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with son.  Smoking history times 55
years; one and a half to two packs per day, quit in [**2121-12-2**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission vital
signs were afebrile, blood pressure 151/83, pulse of 106,
respiratory rate of 22, oxygen saturation of 92% to 96% on 3
liters nasal cannula.  General appearance revealed alert, in
no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Oropharynx was clear.  Extraocular movements were intact.
Neck was supple, no bruits.  Lungs revealed decreased breath
sounds at the right base.  Heart was mildly tachycardic, a
regular rhythm.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended, normal active bowel sounds.  Extremities
revealed no edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
included white blood cell count of 11.3, hematocrit of 41.2,
platelets of 449.  Chem-7 was normal.  INR of 1.  Legionella
urine antigen negative.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Chest CT revealed two suspicious lung
nodules identified in the left lung; one at the left apex
measuring 2.7 cm in greatest dimension with features
characteristic of adenocarcinoma with bronchoalveolar
features.  The second lesion is in the left lower lobe
measuring about 1 cm in diameter and located at the
bifurcation of the posterior and lateral segment bronchi.
This could reflect either a second primary lung cancer; or,
given its location at the bifurcation of the bronchi, a
carcinoid tumor.  In addition, the CT revealed ill-defined
peribronchial nodules in the right lower lobe with associated
small airway disease, likely due to resolving pneumonia.
Additionally, there were small nodules in the right upper
lobe which could also be an inflammatory/infectious, but tiny
fossae of metastatic disease were not excluded.  A direct
comparison to outside CT will be most helpful.  This CT also
revealed thickening of the posterior wall of the right upper
lobe bronchus, possibly related to reactive lymph nodes given
other findings in the right lung but comparison to outside
study would be helpful.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 76-year-old female with a
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral
vascular disease, left lung nodule, and a long history of
tobacco use presenting with pneumonia and hypotension, likely
secondary to subclavian vascular disease and was stable for
transfer to the medical floor from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

The patient was treated with levofloxacin and Flagyl for her
pneumonia for a total course of 10 days.  Her chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease was treated with albuterol, and
Atrovent, and prednisone taper.

Pulmonary was consulted and recommended a CT-guided biopsy of
the left lung nodule which was concerning for bronchogenic
carcinoma.  The patient agreed to CT-guided biopsy but was
currently on aspirin.  The patient was then scheduled for
outpatient biopsy of lung nodule for the following week.  The
patient was to stay off aspirin until biopsy date and will be
n.p.o. after midnight the day prior to biopsy.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Pneumonia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Prednisone taper.
2.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. (total 10-day course).
3.  Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. (total 10-day course).

 HISTORY: Followup study for intracranial hemorrhage.

 TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT scan.

 FINDINGS: Comparison with the prior study of [**2110-7-28**] reveals an
 approximately 2.5 cm wedge shaped area of low absorption within the right
 frontal lobe, with a much smaller low absorption area within the cortex of the
 right temporal lobe. These abnormalities were the site of prior hemorrhages,
 and presumably represent areas of malacic change. There is no hydrocephalus or
 shift of normally midline structures. The surrounding osseous and soft tissue
 structures display no additional abnormalities.

 CONCLUSION: Post traumatic encephalomalacia, as noted above.

ALLERGIES:   None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   The patient was alert and oriented
times one, [**Location (un) 2611**] Coma Scale of 13, moving all extremities
and following commands.  Pupils are equally reactive.  Clear
to auscultation.  Trachea midline.  Regular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen was soft, nontender.  Rectal is guaiac negative and
no gross deformities on back.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count was 15, hematocrit 39,
platelets 276.  Electrolytes were within normal limits.
Toxicology screen positive for ethanol at a level of 38.

Head CT scan showed an acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage,
possibly small right frontal subdural hematoma.  Pelvic x-ray
was read as negative.

CT scan of the cervical spine was read as no fracture.  CT
scan of the abdomen and pelvis was read as negative.  TLS was
also read as negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Neurosurgery was consulted.  According to
their recommendations, an MRI was done as was a follow-up
head CT scan on hospital day number two.  Repeat head CT scan
showed no change from previous and MRI showed no organic
cause for the bleed and confirmed likely traumatic cause.

he began to have nausea, vomitting, loose stools and abdominal
pain. Due to these symptoms he has had limited PO intake. He was
brought to the ED due to persistent loose stools and abdominal
pain.
.
In the ED: VS 97.2 102 101/66 20 100% RA. He had a CTA that
showed a duodenitis and absence of dissection. He was given
Cipro 400mg IV x1, Flagyl 500mg IV x1 given for duodenitis. He
was initially admitted with a hct to 30, and then the following
AM noted to have hct to 22. He was given 1 unit pRBC for this
and transfered to the MICU, though he was hemodynamically stable
throughout. Plan was for patient to undergo an EGD, but this
procedure was held due to a coagulopathy with an INR to 2.3. He
was given 5mg PO vitamin K and 2 units of FFP (INR down to 1.6).
During his blood product transfusion, he developed chest pain
that was left sided, and associated with mild SOB. His ECG
revealed inferolateral ST depressions. His chest pain
self-resolved. Troponins trended from 0.04 to peak of 0.11, most
recently down to 0.1 so no longer being followed. CKs and CK-MB
have been flat throughout. Thought to be consistent with demand
ischemia. Cardiology was consulted and recommended conservative
management with holding ASA and continuing BB.
.
In the MICU, patient received a total of 6 units prbcs, and
eventually hematocrit began to stabilize and increase over the
last 24 hours. Additionally became hypertensive, currently on
BB, started on hydralazine for easy on/off if he develops
hemodynamically significant re-bleed. At this time, patient is
transfered to the medicine floor with plan for EGD in the
morning pending stable INR (1.4 yesterday).
.
At this time, patient is feeling well. No BM for several days,
feels he has more energy. No nausea or vomiting. His only
complaint is his chronic arthritis for which he requests
tylenol. No fevers, chills, abdominal pain, chest pain,
shortness of breath.

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is infero-lateral hypokinesis. The remaining LV
segments appear hyperdynamic and therefore the overall left
ventricular systolic function is preserved (LVEF = 55%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-10-18**],
the LVEF has improved.

CTA CAP:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection or endograft leak s/p aortic
aneurysm

2. Focal thickening in the duodenum with some adjacent fat
stranding,
suggestive of duodenitis.
3. Interval improvement in the left lower lobe consolidation.
4. Air in the bladder. Correlate for recent catheterization.
Otherwise, may represent infection. Correlate with urinalysis.

EGD findings:
Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:
 Mucosa: Diffuse continuous moderate inflammation of the mucosa
with no bleeding was noted in the antrum.
Duodenum:
 Mucosa: Diffuse continuous marked inflammation of the mucosa
with no bleeding was noted throughout the duodenum.
 Excavated Lesions A single cratered non-bleeding 20mm ulcer was
found in the proximal bulb. A small visible vessel was present
in the center of the ulcer. Clipping was attempted, but three
endoquick clips were non-adherent. Some oozing was noted after
the clipping attempt, 4cc of epinephire were injected at the
ulcer border at three separate sites.
Impression: Moderate inflammation in the antrum
Marked inflammation in the duodenum
Ulcer in the proximal bulb
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

preparation for EGD. During administration of 1st unit of blood,
called to bedside for a trigger: Patient had chest pain with ST
Depression in I, II, aVF, V3-6. Resolved with SL Nitroglycerin.
Lipitor 80mg, Lopressor 25mg PO TID restarted. After discussion
with Cardiology & Geriatrics (Primary) 325mg ASA started.
Intermediate Hct drawn after 1.5 Units PRBC administered showing
21.2. At this point the unit was consulted. No blood per rectum,
no hemtatemesis. Patient has no new complaints at this time.
During his ICU admission, the patient received 5 units pRBCs.
Initially, he did not have an appropriate HCT bump, but then he
began to bump appropriately and was hemodynamically stable for
transfer to the floor.  He had no further episodes of melena or
chest pain.  His cardiac enzymes began to trend downwards.  His
HCT goal was greater than 30 given dynamic ECG changes and
likely ischemia.  He was then transferred back to the floor
since he remained hemodynamically stable and bumping
appropriately to pRBCs with no further transfusions. EGD done
which showed non-bleeding ulcer in duodenal bulb with visible
vessel that was not able to be clipped. It was injected with
epinephrine. No further bleeding while admitted.  H. pylori IgG
was checked and was found to be positive prior to discharge.
Patient was discharged on 2 week course of triple therapy for H.
pylori.

# Pneumonia: Patient admitted with PICC line in place from MSSA
Pneumonia.  Nafcillin course completed on [**8-16**], no signs or
symptoms of pneumonia on this admission. PICC line was
discontinued prior to discharge.

# Hypertension:  The patient was initially maintained on home
regimen of Amlodipine, Hydralazine and Lopressor until transfer
to the MICU.  His lopressor was decreased to 12.5 mg TID given
HR in the 50s on telemetry.  His hydralazine was ultimately
decreased to 50mg TID.  He was started on Lisinopril for BP
control in the setting of recent MI.  BP well-controlled at the
time of discharge.

# Anxiety:  The patient was initially maintained on home regimen
of Effexor & Xanax.

# AAA Repair: Assessed and cleared by [**Month/Year (2) **] surgery that
examined the CT and felt there were no issues with the graft.

# Chronic Back pain:  The patient continued home Oxycodone 5mg
PO Q4hrs PRN pain and Neurontin 100mg PO BID.

# Stage [**Month/Year (2) 1105**] CKD: The patient's Cr was below baseline of 1.7-2
during admission after fluid administration and low PO intake
over the last few weeks.  His baseline Cr 1.7-2, secondary to
hypertension.

# CAD: Patient maintained on home beta blocker and
anti-hypertensives.  Home Aspirin was held during the acute
bleed. Otherwise as above.  It was also held at the time of
discharge per primary attending until seen by GI given how large
the patient's bleed had been.  Restarting this medication should
be discussed with the patiet's primary care physician as an
outpatient.

# Coagulopathy: INR was 2.3 at the time of admission.  Improved
with vitamin K, FFP and increased nutrition. Was likely due to
malnutrition and was stable and improved prior to discharge.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81 year old
woman with a history of meningioma removal in [**2091**], stroke in
[**2105**], pulmonary embolism in [**2102**].  She is on Coumadin. She
had a fall five days ago, hitting her head.  Yesterday, she
was standing by the bed when she again fell.  This time, she
hit the back of her head around 8:30 p.m.  She was lying on
the floor for ten hours before being found by her son in the
morning.  She could not stand up. She was taken to an outside
hospital, which showed a subdural hematoma. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].  She had
no loss of consciousness the morning of the fall.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, her
temperature was 97.9; blood pressure was 221/74, heart rate
63; respiratory rate 14; saturation 98% on room air.  In
general, she was in no acute distress.  Cardiac:  Regular
rate and rhythm, no murmur.  Chest was clear to auscultation.
Neurologically, she was alert and attentive, oriented times
three, fluent speech.  Extraocular movements full.  Face:
Sensation was intact.  She had no facial droop; question of a
left old one from her old stroke. Tongue was midline.  Palate
was gross symmetrically.  Strength was [**5-16**] in all muscle
groups.  Sensation was intact to light touch.  Finger to nose
and coordination were intact. Her gait was deferred secondary
to her critical condition on admission. She also had a left
ptosis and history of right leg weakness and left ptosis from
previous stroke and surgery.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit.  She was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit.  She had
a repeat CAT scan which showed stable appearance of a left
subdural hematoma. She also has a right subdural hematoma
which was found to be stable as well.  The patient was
monitored in the Intensive Care Unit. Her blood pressure was
kept under 150.  She was restarted on her p.o. medications
although she still continued to have some episodes of
hypertension, requiring some intravenous medication.  She did
remain stable and was transferred to the floor on [**2112-12-21**].
She remains neurologically stable.  Repeat head CT today is
stable. She was offered surgery (craniotomy) to decompress the
Left Subdural hematoma, but the patient refused.

She was seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy and
found to be safe for discharge to home with a walker and home
safety evaluation.  Her condition was stable at the time of
discharge.

MEDICATIONS:
Metoprolol XL 250 mg p.o. q h.s.; hold for systolic less than
100 and heart rate less than 50.

Chief Complaint:
Acute pancreatitis.
Presumed pancreatic injury from percutaneous biopsy.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory Laparotomy,
Wide drainage of pancreatic leak
Placement of a combined gastrostomy/jejunostomy tube (MIC tube).


History of Present Illness:
This unfortunate 24-year-old lady had hepatitis B and was being
worked up for this with a biopsy of her liver. It is uncertain
to my why she required
this biopsy. The patient had this done in the midline
position 2 days prior to this procedure. In the interim, she
became very sick and was treated at another hospital.

She developed abdominal and went to NSMC-[**Hospital1 1281**] ED where workup
was significant for lipase of [**2110**] and amylase of 1351. CT
showed diffuse hypoattenuation of the liver, suggestive of
infiltration, and small amount of ascites. She was admitted with
a diagnosis of acute pancreatitits. On evening of [**6-3**], she
became febrile and tachycardic. Repeat laboratories showed WBC
29.3 (from 20.0), amylase 3894 (from 1351), and lipase >2400
(from [**2110**]). Repeat CT showed increase in intraperitoneal fluid,
pelvic fluid, and bilateral pleural effusions
She was transferred to our facility the day of this operation.
In the
interim, she developed clear-cut acute pancreatitis and was
gravely ill. We found her to be profoundly dehydrated with
all the sequelae of raging acute pancreatitis. What was
worrisome, however, was her abdominal exam which showed
peritonitis. In reviewing the reports, there was apparently a
percutaneous biopsy attempt of the left lateral sector of the
liver. It was pretty clear that there was a traumatic injury
to the pancreas through this biopsy precipitating acute
pancreatitis. I was very concerned that there was a ductal
leak injury given her clinical state with a rigid abdomen
with peritoneal signs.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted on [**6-4**]//07 with a presumed pancreatic leak and
peritoneal signs, fever, elevated WBC, tachycardic.

# pancreatitis:
She was NPO and started on IVF resuscitation. She was receiving
Morphine for pain control.
She went to the OR later that evening for Exploratory
laparotomy; Wide drainage of pancreatic bed for pancreatic leak;
Placement of a combined gastrostomy/jejunostomy tube (MIC tube).

On POD 2, she was extubated. She continued to have fevers for
several days post-op, with a Tm 103.4. Blood cultures were
negative.
She was found to be MRSA+, likely colonized. C.diff was
negative. Urine grew out E.coli and she was started on Cipro for
a UTI. She continued to have a WBC and intermittent fevers. She
went for a ERCP for stent removal on [**2156-6-14**]. Her WBC trended
down, she was not having fevers and clinically was stable.

Her LFTs, Amylase and Lipase continued to trend down and did not
bump with PO intake. Her pancreatitis seemed to resolve.

#Abd/GI: She had 2 JP drains in place and a GJ feeding tube. Her
midlin incision was C/D/I.  The staples were removed on POD 11
and steri strips placed. The other drains will remain in place
for now.

# Tachycardia: Normal response to acute pancreatitis, improved
with IVF resuscitation and as fevers trended down.
.
# Chronic HBV
- monitor clinically
.
# FEN:
She was NPO, IVF. She was started on trophic tubefeedings on POD
4 and started on clear liquids on POD 5. Her lytes were repleted
PRN. Her diet was advanced over the next few days. She was able
to tolerate food and her tubefeedings were discontined.

Pertinent Results:
MRI [**11-19**]: Essentially stable appearance of soft tissue
edema/inflammation
without evidence of osteomyelitis or drainable abscess
collection. Slightly
heterogeneous signal within the dependent portions of the iliac
bones is non-
specific, and most likely represents hematopoietic marrow.

CT abdomen [**11-18**]: No intra-abdominal fluid collections.

CT chest [**11-14**]: Multiple nodular and focal patchy opacities
bilaterally of different sizes, many of which show evidence of
cavitation. The largest of these within the
right upper lobe although all lobes are affected. These findings
are
consistent with septic emboli. 2. Elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm. Tiny right-sided pleural effusion which is
layering posteriorly. 3. Gastric varices.

MRI Pelvis [**2170-11-7**]: No evidence of intraosseous infection.
CXR [**2170-11-7**] AP: Increased right pleural effusion with right
lower lobe atelectasis vs. PNA. Increased pulmonary edema vs.
diffuse infection.
CXR [**2170-11-6**] AP: Left upper lobe, right upper lobe infiltrates
suggestive of PMA. Diffuse intersitital opacities suggestive of
pulmonary edema vs. infxn

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  sacral abscess - Abscess was incised and drained in the ED.
Surgery consult obtained, and this was felt to be subcutaneous
abscess rather than pilonidal cyst.  Wound cultures grew out
MRSA.  Pt placed on vancomycin, ultimately for a 4-week course.
Wound vac was placed, with surgery following and doing dressing
changes.  Wound vac discontinued prior to discharge per surgery
team; wet-to-dry dressings were performed, and eventually dry
gauze dressings.  No evidence of further infection, with abscess
appearing to be healing well by discharge.  Pt will follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in surgery in 4 weeks.

2.  MRSA sepsis - Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from the ED on a
non-rebreather mask, hypotensive on a levophed drip which was
weaned off and the patient remained stable, transferred from
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the floor on [**2170-11-8**].  On arrival, pt's CVP continued
to be low ([**4-23**]), with further fluid resuscitation resulting in
adequate BP.  Levophed drip was stopped 48 hours later, and BP
remained stable throughout rest of course.  Pt had multiple
further blood cultures for surveillance purposes, which were
negative.  Last positive blood culture was on [**11-5**].  Pt on
vanco for 4 week course after first negative blood culture.
Vancomycin trough levels were persistently low, with continual
uptitrating of the dose, up to 1750mg IV q12, and then
ultimately was 1000mg IV q8h with a therapeutic trough level.

3.  pneumonia - Pt noted to have multiple patchy opacities on
CXR and chest CT, some of these lesions were noted to be
cavitating.  ID was involved early in the course of [**Hospital **]
hospital stay.  3 AFB smears were negative, PCP via sputum
induction was negative, Legionella urinary antigen was negative,
Cryptococcus negative.  A PPD was placed, which was negative, as
well.  CXR showed right pleural effusion with right lower lobe
atelectasis vs. pneumonia. This was evaluated with U/S probe and
it was determined that the fluid collection was too small to be
tapped.  Findings on CT scan were consistent with septic emboli,
so a TTE and then TEE were performed, both of which were
negative for any vegetations.  Per ID, it is thought that these
are septic emboli, likely of MRSA, from some intravascular
source but not valvular vegetations.  The appearance of these
nodules, in their cavitations is consistent with Staph
pneumonia, possibly from hematogenous spread.  Pt was placed on
4 week course of vanco, and he continued to improve overall,
feeling well by the time of discharge.  He maintained good O2
sats and showed no respiratory distress.  A followup CT scan was
arranged prior to discharge, and pt will follow up in [**Hospital **] clinic
to determine if the vancomycin may be discontinued.

4.  fevers - fevers persisted even with the vancomycin on board.
 Pt's cultures were consistently negative and no changes noted
on repeat chest imaging.  Pt clinically was well-appearing in
the last week or so before discharge, but was still having
fevers.  Other sources of fever were searched for: an abdominal
CT showed no fluid collections or occult abscesses; an MRI of
the sacral area near the abscess ruled out osteomyelitis.  It
was thought that perhaps his subtherapeutic vanco dose might be
responsible for this.  However, no further causes of infection
were found, and pt was clinically well.  Pt remained afebrile
for > 4 days prior to discharge.

5.  HIV - CD4 count low 189, but pt had an acute infectious
process going on.  Repeat CD4 count when pt more stable was 454.
 Bactrim prophylaxis was stopped.  Pt will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4844**] in [**Month (only) 404**] of next year.  No HAART while in house.

6.  HSV - pt had some oral HSV and completed a 7-day course of
famciclovir with resolution of symptoms.

7.  gastric varices - varices were found incidentally on CT
scan.  LFTs were mildly elevated.  Pt asymptomatic.  Abd CT scan
did not comment on any liver abnormalities.  An outpatient EGD
appointment was arranged to better assess these varices, as well
as a subsequent liver clinic appointment.

 INDICATION:  72-year-old woman with bilateral periprosthetic fractures.
 Evaluate fractures.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison to [**2175-2-8**].  Extensive postoperative changes of both
 femurs and hips are identified.  On the right, there is a right total hip
 replacement with severe remodeling of the right acetabulum and superior
 migration of the acetabular component.  The femoral diaphysis has been fixed
 with a long lateral plate and multiple screws without interval change in
 alignment.  There is two cerclage bands are also seen.  No additional fracture
 or dislocation is identified on the right.  On the left, there is a left-sided
 bipolar prosthesis.  The left femoral diaphysis has been fixed with a long
 lateral plate multiple screws as well as a single cerclage band.  A left
 tricompartmental total knee replacement is seen.  Apparent lucency at the
 prosthesis/bone and cement interface of the left tibial component may reflect
 loosening.  Extensive vascular calcification is seen.  There is obscuration of
 the sacrum due to overlying bowel gas.  Degenerative changes of the sacroiliac
 joints in lower lumbar spine are noted.  Soft tissues are otherwise
 unremarkable.  Skin clips are seen.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Postoperative changes status post open reduction internal fixation of
 bilateral periprosthetic fractures of the femoral diaphyses without evidence
 of change in alignment or hardware-related complication.

 2.  Tricompartmental left total knee replacement with lucency at the
 prosthesis/bone interface of the tibial component, possibly reflecting
 loosening.

 3.  Bipolar hip prostheses with remodeling of the right acetabulum and
 superior migration of the left femur as before.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 70391**] is a 73-year-old female patient who fell from
standing resulting in bilateral femur fractures which were
periprosthetic. On the left side, she has a hip hemiarthroplasty
and total knee, and on the right side she has a hip

Orthopaedics department and found to have bilateral
periprostetic femur fractures. She is s/p Bilateral total hip
replacements. Reduction was attempted, but unsucessful. She was
placed in bilateral leg braces for stabilization. She was
admitted to the medicine service and cleared for surgery. On
[**2175-2-2**], she was prepped and brought down to the operating room
for surgery. Intra-operatively, she was closely monitored and
remained hemodynamically stable. She tolerated the procedure
well without any difficulty or complication. Post-operatively,
she was extubated and transferred to the PACU for further
stabilization and monitoring. She was then transferred to the
floor for further recovery. On POD #1, she was transfused 2
units of PRBC for postoperative anemia. She then remained
hemodynamically stable and her pain was controlled. She
progressed with physical therapy to improve her strength and
mobility. She continues to make steady progress without any
incidents. She was discharged to a rehabilitation facility in
stable condition. She was instructed to call Dr.[**Name (NI) 4016**]

Brief Hospital Course:
45 year old Spanish speaking male admitted to T/SICU status post
fall from 15-20 feet at work. Landed on head with resultant
injuries including, traumatic burst fracture of the T3 vertebral
body with retropulsion of multiple fragments posteriorly as well
as angulation of the spinal canal at this level, fracture of the
posterior elements of T1 and T2 -> s/p Fusion, Right transverse
distal radial fracture, sternal manubrial fracture dissociation,
and a head laceration. Patient underwent C5-T10 posterior spinal
fusion with L1-L4 posterior decompression as well as open
reduction and internal fixation of his right wrist fracture
[**2152-9-22**].  He was given 7 liters of crystalloid and 1200 cc of
red blood cells in the operating room during the spinal fusion.
See operative reports for procedure details. Patient tolerated
both procedures reasonably well but was found to be hypotensive
after spinal fusion and was transfused 2 additional units of
packed red blood cells when transported back to the Trauma/SICU
after surgery. He was placed on spinal precautions and given a
[**Location (un) 36323**] brace to wear after extubation. The patient's
respiratory status was managed on a ventilator.

On [**9-24**], patient was transfrused 2 units of packed red blood
cells and was febrile to 104 with a whit blood cell count to
16.4 He was started on Vancomycin and ZIsyn for broad spectrum
coverage. Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted on
[**9-25**] and followed patient throughout hospital course with
satisfactory results.

On [**9-26**], patient was taken to operating room for ORIF of right
distal radius fracture without event. See operative reports for
procedure details. Infectious Disease was consulted for
continued fevers and recommended standard fever workup including
pan culture, d/c lines fpr 2 days with central line exchange,
stool studies, sputum cultures (patient underwent multiple
bronchial alveolar lavages for sputum collection), and
strongyloides. Please see microbiology results above for
details. An ascaris worm was removed from patient's nostril in
entirety and sent to pathology for identification. ID followed
patient throughout hospital stay and recommendations were
followed. Levoquin was added to antibiotic regimen on [**10-2**].
Vanco/Zosyn discontinued on [**10-14**]. Patient is to continue
Levaquin until [**10-23**] for sputum culture positive for Acintobacter
10/24 per ID recommendations.

On [**9-28**], arterial line was reinserted and received 2 untis PRBC
for hematocrit of 23 and CT of spine was performed to eval for
abscesses. Please see results section for details. Nutrition
followed patient throughout course and recommendations followed
regarding tube feeds/TPN. On [**9-29**] social work wrote letter to
Mexican Vice Consul in [**Location (un) 86**] regarding patient's status and was
instrumental in obtaining family contact and visas. Social work
was actively involved in patient's care throughout stay. On
[**9-29**] had spontaneous breathing trail but tired after 4 hours
and was placed back on mechanical ventilation.

Please note patient had multiple fever spikes throughout course,
was pan cultured with each spike > 102. Please see above culture
data for details. On the final spike before discharge, he
underwent an interventional radiology drainage of a superficial
fluid collection over T2 and T3. Fluid was cultured and found to
be without infection. He was also tested for tuberculosis,
Hepatitis A/B/C, CMV, HIV, Legionella, which were all negative.
AFB was negative x 3.

On [**10-3**] he underwent tracheostomy, PEG, and IVC filter
placement for spinal cord injury with prolonged respiratory
dependency, malnutrition and right risk for venous embolic
disease. See operative reports for details. He tolerated that
procedure without complication. Initially after tracheostomy,
the patient's respiratory status was managed with assist control
ventilation. However, as he recovered and gained muscle
strength, he was weaned over to CPAP with pressure support and
remained stable throughout the rest of his hospital stay. His
pressure support was slowly weaned to 5.

Forehead staples removed on [**10-5**] and arterial line was removed.
 On [**12-10**], a fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing was
performed which showed mild oral pharyngeal dysphagia with
minimal aspiration. With recommendation to repeat swallowing
evaluation at rehab facility. On [**10-11**] patient underwent a TEE
which showed no evidence of subacute bacterial endocardiditis.
On [**10-12**], patient complained of a visual field defect and
Ophthalmology was consulted with no recommendations for
intervention. Thoughts were consistent with traumatic
maculopathy which should slowly improve. Patient should follow
up in [**Hospital 68264**] clinic as an outpatient in [**1-21**] weeks.
Patient remained stable, cooperative, and cordial throught
duration of hospital stay. He was afebrile for > 48 hours before
discharge.

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year old
previously healthy male who, on the day of admission,
presented to an outside hospital complaining of substernal
chest pain with radiation to the left arm.

The patient says that in the weeks prior to admission, he had
symptoms consistent with indigestion, which was not being
resolved with Tums.  On the day of admission, he was working
on his boat and developed the chest pain.  After 20 minutes,
during which the pain did not resolve, he called 911.

On the scene, there were ST elevations noted on the
electrocardiogram.  The patient was treated with aspirin and
nitroglycerin and the nitroglycerin relieved the pain.  He
continued to have left arm discomfort.  He denied any
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.  He
also denied any fevers, chills or sweats.

The patient was taken to the outside hospital and underwent a
workup for a myocardial infarction.  He remained
hemodynamically stable.  His hematocrit was 40.  There, he
underwent cardiac catheterization which was significant for a
left anterior descending artery with an ostial 60% stenosis
followed by serial 90% stenosis.  It also showed the left
circumflex with 80% stenosis, an obtuse marginal two which
was totally occluded, and an obtuse marginal three which was
90% stenotic.  The right coronary artery was totally
occluded.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] to Dr.[**Name (NI) 27686**]
service for emergent coronary artery bypass grafting.  The
patient arrived at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] in
stable condition.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Negative; the patient denies diabetes
mellitus, hypertension or hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Negative.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Tums p.r.n. indigestion; the
patient arrived from the outside hospital on aspirin, Plavix,
heparin drip and nitroglycerin.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any alcohol or tobacco
use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
was an elderly gentleman in no acute distress, currently
without angina.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or
gallop.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, no masses.  Extremities:
Warm, no edema.  Neurologic:  Intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count was 7.5,
hematocrit 40.1, platelet count 334,000, sodium 139,
potassium 3.9, chloride 98, bicarbonate 32, BUN 16,
creatinine 0.7, glucose 149, and calcium 9.9.
Electrocardiogram show normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 69
beats per minute, borderline first degree A-V block, and
diffuse ST elevations.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from an outside
hospital in stable condition.  He arrived at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] and, after evaluation by
cardiothoracic surgery, the patient was taken to the
Operating Room, where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting times three.  The grafts were left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal one and saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal two, performed by the team under Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**].  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  An EVH
was performed on the right side with hypertechnique of the
right graft.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.  The
patient was extubated without any incident.  He was slowly
weaned off of oxygen.  The patient's cardiovascular status
remained stable.  Initially, cardiac output was 1.9.  The
patient received one unit of packed red blood cells and a
bolus of lactated Ringer's.  Output slowly improved to 2.39.
He continued to remain hemodynamically stable.  The patient
remained alert and oriented times three.

On postoperative day number one, the patient was transferred
to the floor in stable condition.  On postoperative day
number one at 11:00 p.m., the patient's monitor recorded wide
complex ventricular tachycardia.  The patient's blood
pressure remained in the 110s.  The patient was asymptomatic.
The longest continuous run included a 12 beat run.
Otherwise, the patient's rhythm remained alternating between
sinus rhythm intermixed with wide QRS complexes, often two to
three beats at a time.  The patient's blood pressure
continued to remain stable.  The patient's electrolytes were
repleted and the patient spontaneously converted to a normal
sinus rhythm.

The patient was evaluated by the electrophysiology service
and it was determined that the patient likely had reperfusion
ventricular tachycardia.  The patient has since remained in
sinus rhythm and hemodynamically stable.  The patient
otherwise has remained afebrile.  His chest tubes were
discontinued on postoperative day number two without
incident.  Pacing wires were discontinued on postoperative
day number three without incident.  The patient is ambulating
at a level 5.

Early in postoperative day number two, there was a question
of patient's mental status.  Though the patient remained
alert and oriented times three, the patient continually
requested to be driving home.  He was placed on close
observation.  The patient's mental status has improved and he
is at baseline.

On postoperative day number three, the patient's hematocrit
had moved from 24 to 20.8.  The patient was transfused two
units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit remained
stable.  The patient is now stable and ready for discharge to
home.

 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest x-rays.

 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest x-ray from [**2143-7-4**].

 FINDINGS:  Compared to the chest x-ray from [**2143-7-4**], there is increased
 retrosternal density, which might be consistent with retrosternal hematoma in
 the right clinical setting.  There is no radiographic evidence of a fluid
 collection anterior to the sternum.
 There is a small right pleural effusion. Pleural effusion on the left has
 resolved. There is a plate-like left basilar atelectasis. There are 8 intact
 sternal wires without evidence of hardware failure.

 IMPRESSION:  Increased retrosternal density, in the right clinical setting
 consistent with retrosternal fluid collection or retrosternal hematoma.  No
 radiographic evidence of anterior sternal fluid collection.  If clinically
 indicated, CT is recommended for further evaluation.  Sternal wires are
 intact.

 Findings were discussed with the clinical team

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2141-5-3**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler. The IVC was not visualized. The RA pressure could
not be estimated.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Abnormal septal motion/position.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR. No PS. Normal main PA.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Left pleural effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No pericardial effusion. Normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-5-3**],
the findings are similar.

Images:
[**10-7**] Chest AP: Low lung volumes with known idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis. While a subtle superimposed acute consolidation in the
lung bases is difficult to exclude, it would be highly
coincidental and is felt less likely with the increased opacity
likely due to crowding.

CXR ([**10-8**]):
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Status post sternotomy, status post valvular
replacement. The
external and internal pacemaker with leads are visible.
Unchanged evidence of a right basal opacity with a predominantly
reticular pattern, that might, in part be, fibrotic.  These are
likely to be related to the known history of idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis. There is no evidence of fluid overload on
the current image. No pleural effusions. No parenchymal
opacities have newly occurred.
.
CT Torso: [**10-27**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis with mild bibasilar
consolidations, worse on the right than the left, likely
reflecting atelectasis, although
superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
2. Status post right mastectomy.
3. Cholelithiasis in a nondistended gallbladder with mild wall
edema/pericholecystic fluid likely reflects either CHF or
hypoproteinemia.
4. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
5. No evidence of intra-abdominal free air or organized fluid
collection.
6. Indistinct pancreatic head; correlate with pancreatic enzymes
if clinical concern for pancreatitis.
.
RUQ US [**10-25**]
1. Sludge and stones in the gallbladder neck without other
findings to
suggest acute cholecystitis. If there is continued clinical
concern, a HIDA scan may be more definitive in the exclusion of
acute cholecystitis.
2. Dilated hepatic veins consistent with diastolic dysfunction

Brief Hospital Course:
76 y.o woman with PMH of IPF,COPD,anemia, mechanical mitral
valve,and pacemaker presents with worsening dyspnea, acute renal
failure, and fluid overload.

#. Anemia: On admission hemoglobin of 4.6 and hematocrit of 14.2
from a
hgb 10 and hct 33.1 within the last several weeks. Hemolysis
labs negative, and rectal exam showed guiac positive brown
stool. Her anemia was believed to be secondary to a GI bleed.
She was transfused 4 units total with appropriate hct response,
and her hct/hgb ramined stable. She underwent EGD/colonoscopy
which showed esophageal and fundal varices and a large polyp in
the colon, concerning for malignancy which was believed to be
the source of bleeding.  On biopsy, this lesion was found to be
an adenoma with high grade dysplasia. Gastroenterology believed
that it would be possible to perform a transluminal resection
but that the procedure would have high risk of perforation and
death. After a goals of care discussion with the [**Hospital 228**]
health care proxy, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 15155**], and the gastroenterology team
it was decided that though the adenoma is high risk for
malignancy, she will likely succumb to her severe pulmonary
disease in the next 1-5 years and removal of the mass is not in
line with her goals of care. She was started on nadolol for
esophageal varaces.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Obtain 2x weekly HCTs and transfuse for HCT <21
-- Continue Fe supplementation and epo administration
.
#. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient presented on 5L
trans-trach from a baseline of 4L at home in the setting of
known IPF, COPD, and chronic heart failure.  Her dyspnea was
attributed to anemia vs fluid overload from CHF, and remained
stable in-house and gradually improved upon discharge from the
ICU.  There was low suspicion for a COPD or IPF exacerbation.
She was given IV Torsemide for diuresis with her packed red cell
transfusions, and her home Bumex was held in-house.  Her home
prednisone and nebulizers were continued in-house.  Related to
her shortness of breath, she occassionally coughed up ""blood
balls"", which she attributed to bloodly mucous originating at
her catheter site.  These were inconsistent, and associated with
epistaxis, and we believed that there was a component of bloody
post-nasal drip contributing, exacerbated by the fact that she
was on a heparin gtt for her heart valve.  The total blood loss
from these episodes was essentially non-contributory.  On the
floor, she continued to be dyspneic at times.  She was found to
have evidence of a RUL HAP, so she was started empirically on
vancomycin and cefepime. She developed progressive respiratory
distress and returned the MICU where she was intubated. She
underwent broncheoalveolar lavage which was culture negative and
her antibiotics were discontinued on [**10-23**]. She continued to be
intermittently diuresed but it was stopped when her creatinine
bumped from 1.8 to 2.7. She was extubated and returned to the
medical floor with o2 sats 95% on 2LNC The thought is that her
respiratory distress was likely due to a mucus plug and
pulmonary edema. After two days on the medical floor, she pulled
out a nasogastric tube which had been used for tubefeeds,
aspirated and developed respiratory distress with hypoxia and
acidemia. She was transferred to the MICU for a third time where
she was again intubated. Out of concern for HCAP the pt was
started on vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]. Due to increasing wbc and decreased stool
output there was also concern for c.diff, which ultimately was
positive, and the pt was started on flagyl/PO vanc. The pt's
respiratory status improved and she was successfully extubated.
Vancomycin was discontinued on [**10-30**] with plan to complete a
total of 8d of meropenem.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Continue meropenem thru [**11-3**].
-- Ongoing discussion regarding replacement of transtracheal
catheter.
.
#Clostridium Difficile: The pt was found to have a rising WBC,
episodes of hypotension and decreased stool output. She was
empirically started on IV flagyl and PO vanco which were
continued when stool culture was positive for c.diff. Pt had
subsequent decreased in WBC to normal with improvement in loose
stools.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Plan to complete PO vancomycin 125mg PO Q6hrs as well as
Flagyl 500mg Q8hrs; end date [**11-9**].
.
#Anticoagulation: Patient anticoagulated due to presence of
mechanical valve. Patient presented with an INR of 10 for
unclear reasons.  She received 5mg PO Vit K, and her INR
down-trended to the sub-therapeutic range and she was started on
a Heparin gtt for her mechanical mitral valve.  She experienced
epistaxis and coughed up bloody mucus in the setting of a
slightly supratherapeutic PTT which resolved with decreasing her
Heparin gtt.  She was kept on a heparin drip for bridging on the
medicine floor.  When the decision was made to pursue
endomucosal resection of her adenoma, her warfarin was
discontinued, however given this was put on hold, the pt was
restarted on coumadin [**10-29**]. At time of discharge patient
remained on hep gtt as well as coumadin 3mg daily; INR on day of
discharge 1.9
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- COntinue hep gtt and coumadin until INR therapeutic (2.5 -
3.5).
.
#Volume Status/Acute Renal Failure. Patient with oscillating
renal function in house. Peak   Cr 2.8 from a baseline of ~1.4,
likely secondary to hypovolemia as well as renal hypoperfusion
[**2-27**] anemia.  Urine lytes showed were consistent with
hypovolemia. Initially Bumex was held and she was given IV
hydration. Creatinine increased from 1.8-2.7 in the setting of
diuresis (as above) and bumex was held. During hospital stay
patient was intermittently diuresised and prior to discharge
restarted on PO Bumex 5mg daily with creatinine of 1.7. Weight
at time of discharge: 62.4kg ; sating >95% on 5L NC.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Pleae continue Bumex 5mg PO daily; monitor weights daily as
well as renal function; may consider increasing bumex to [**Hospital1 **] or
transitioning to IV if weight increases >3lb
.
# Esophageal Varices. Newly diagnosed. Patient placed on nadolol
10mg daily.
.
# Hypertension. Patient largely hypotensive to normotensive in
house. Decision made to hold home amlodipine 5mg daily as well
as spironolactone 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at time of discharge.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Close hemodynamic monitoring; plan to re-initiate
anti-hypertensives if needed.
.
# Pulmonary fibrosis. Patient with transtracheal O2 catheter as
well as use of chronic steriods as an outpatient. During 1st
intubation transtracheal cath was removed. In house patient
received stress dose steriods which were weanted to home
prednisone 10mg daily at time of discharge.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Continue chronic prednisone; consider need for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]
[**Name9 (PRE) **] Continue discussion re replacement of transtracheal cath
.
# Hypernatremia. Patient noted to be intermittently
hypernatremic when NPO/intubated. Received free water boluses
thru NGT as well as IV D5 with improvement. Na at time of
discharge 152
OUTPATIENT
-- Continue monitoring of electrolytes; encourage PO intake and
adminster D5W if needed (however by cautious in setting of known
diastolic CHF).

# Goals of Care: On [**2137-10-25**] a goals of care discussion was held
with the patient's HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 15155**]. The decision was made to
forgo aggressive management of the colonic adenoma as her life
expectancy with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (which she has
suffered with for ~8 years) is now less than 5 years and likely
less than one. The family wanted the patient to remain full code
and to have aggressive management of her pulmonary disease.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms [**Known lastname **] it was a pleasure taking care of you.

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of GI bleed and while
in house you developed respiratory compromise requiring
intubation.
.
Regarding the GI bleed, you were seen by our team of GI doctors
who performed a colonscopy. During the procedure a colonic
lesion was seen and a plan was devised to proceed for excisional
biopsy. You were transfused RBCs as needed and your blood counts
were monitored closely. After discussion with your family the
decision to undergo biopsy was deferred to the outpatient
setting.
.
While in house your breathing became labored on several
occassions which required intubation twice. The cause of the
distress included aspiration and possible pneumonia. You were
started on antibiotics with a plan to complete an 8d course.
Your transtracheal catheter was removed with plan to discuss
replacement as an outpatient. At time of discharge you were
oxygenating well using supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal
cannula.

Also you were noted to have an infection in your GI tract and
were started on antiobiotics to eradicate this bacteria.

Prior to discharge you were feeling much improved and the
decision was made to transition to a nursing facility/rehab
where you can work to optimize strength, mobility and nutrition.
.
CHANGES TO YOUR MEDICATIONS:
START 10mg Nadolol daily for gastric varices
CONTINUE MEROPENEM until [**2137-11-3**]
CONTINUE VANCOMYCIN AND FLAGYL until [**2137-11-9**]
STOP SPIRONOLACTONE and AMLODIPINE until told otherwise
CHANGE COUMADIN to 3mg daily (goal INR 2.5 to 3.5)
CHANGE BUMEX to 5mg daily (previously 5mg twice a day)

Again it was a pleasure taking care of you. Please contact with
any questions or concerns.

Surgeon:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**MD Number(1) 4158**]

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Acetabular fracture, posterior wall,
significantly comminuted.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Acetabular fracture, posterior
wall, significantly comminuted.

PROCEDURE:  Open reduction internal fixation of left
posterior wall acetabular fracture.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  Mr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] is a 65 year-
old gentleman who was involved in a motor vehicle accident,
resulting in the above injury. He now presents for operative
fixation.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:  This is an extremely difficult case.
The posterior wall was comminuted in at least 5 major parts
with significant amounts of moderate impaction requiring
subchondral grafting.  The case merits billing under modified
22 considerations. The case was made difficult given the
amount of comminution and need for impaction grafting and the
need for double plating of the posterior wall, in addition to
placement of lag screws to secure fixation.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought to the
operating room and after successful induction of general
anesthesia, he was placed in the supine position and then
transferred to the lateral decubitus position with the left
side up.  After prepping and draping the gluteal region and
leg, the fracture was exposed via a [**Doctor Last Name **] approach.  The
external rotators were identified, tagged and cut. The
quadratus was preserved.  The sciatic nerve was visualized
and protected throughout the procedure by keeping the knee
flexed and the hip extended.  There were significant amounts
of hematoma given the dislocated nature of the joint during
the trauma. The fracture fragments of the posterior wall were
identified and were found to be numerous.  They were
preserved with their attachments in order to preserve the
vascularity.  The amount of clot and interposed soft tissue
was aggressively debrided and the wound was lavaged with
pulsed irrigation. There were significant amounts of
longitudinal impaction which was elevated with a [**Doctor Last Name **] and
then grafted with 30 cc of cancellous chips.  Single layer of
fracture fragments were reduced and held in position with K
wires and then with lag screws of the 3.5 mm cortical
variety.  Subsequently, two 3.5 mm reconstruction plates were
contoured and applied to the posterior wall in a buttress
manner.  Fluoroscopy in the AP as well as oblique and
anteriorly were used to confirm that the fixation was
appropriate.  No screws were angled into the joint.  The
patient's range of motion and stability was acceptable. The
wound was then copiously irrigated and closed in layers with
Vicryl sutures.  Ethibond sutures were used to repair the
external rotators.  Staples were placed in the skin. The
wound was covered with sterile dressings. The patient will be
given postoperative precautions and touch-down weight bearing
only.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] was present for the entire procedure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] presented to the emergency department from an
outside hospital s/p MVA as an unrestrained passenger. He was
evaluated by the Orthopaedics department and found to have a
fracture to his left posterior acetabular wall, C6-6 vertebral
body Fx and C7 facet and lamina Fxs. The hip was internally
reduced in the ED. She was then admitted and consented for
surgery. On [**2133-5-29**], he was prepped and brought down to the
operating room for surgery to his left lower extremity.
Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and remained
hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well without
any difficulty or complication. Post-operatively, he was
extubated and transferred to the PACU for further stabilization
and monitoring. He was then transferred to the floor for further
recovery. On the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable with
his pain controlled. He progressed with physical therapy to
improve his strength and mobility. He continues to make steady
progress without any incidents. He was discharged to a
rehabilitation facility in stable condition. He was instructed

Service:  Trauma Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 87-year-old
female who was a pedestrian struck by a car at approximately
40 miles per hour.  She had a loss of consciousness
documented approximately 20 minutes.  She was intubated at
the scene and was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Department via Life Flight.  She was
hypotensive during transport and was given intravenous
fluids.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Unknown at the time of presentation.
Per family, hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Rhinoplasty times two.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  The patient takes a hypertensive
medication, the name of which is unknown.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient arrived
intubated with sedation and perlitic medications on board.
Vital signs revealed her temperature was 97, her blood
pressure was 120/69, her heart rate was 50, her respiratory
rate was 18, intubated with 100% saturation.   Her head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination showed periorbital
swelling of the left eye with a sluggish pupillary reaction
to light, from 4 mm to 3 mm.  The right eye was reactive to
light from 3 mm to 2 mm.  The patient had an obvious
laceration across her left eyelid which superficial in
nature.  She had a large central forehead laceration with
tissue deficit and rectalis muscle exposure.  There were no
obvious stepoffs of her facial bone.  Her tympanic membranes
were clear bilaterally.  The tongue was midline.  Airway was
confirmed with visualization of the tube through the cords.
She had a regular rate and rhythm.  There were no murmurs.
She had clear breath sounds to auscultation bilaterally.
There were no obvious deformities of her chest.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There were positive
bowel sounds.  However, there were multiple superficial
abrasions across her belly; consistent with ""road rash.""  Her
pelvis appeared stable to palpation.  The cervical and
thoracolumbosacral spine had no obvious deformities or
stepoff.  She was guaiac-negative with good rectal tone.
There were obvious deformities of the bilateral lower
extremities with ecchymoses and swelling of both knees.  She
had 2+ radial pulses bilaterally, and 2+ femoral pulses
bilaterally, and she had 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 14, her hematocrit was 22, and her platelets
were 181.  Chemistry-7 was unremarkable.  The patient had an
INR of 1.2.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computed tomography on
admission showed no intracranial hemorrhage.

A computed tomography of the cervical spine showed
degenerative changes; no acute changes.

A chest computed tomography was negative.

An abdominal and pelvic computed tomography showed superior
and inferior rami fracture with right pelvic hematoma and a
right sacral ala fracture.

Thoracolumbosacral films showed a L1 compression fracture.

Bilateral femur films showed a right tibia/fibula fracture, a
right pubic fracture, and a left tibial plateau fracture.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was transferred to
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in an intubated condition.
She required neurologic checks and serial hematocrit checks.

On hospital day two, it was noted that her hematocrit had
reached a level of 26.5, and she received 2 units of packed
red blood cells.  She was re-scanned to determine where the
bleeding was coming from, and it was found that she had
bilateral intraventricular hemorrhages and a parietal
subarachnoid hematoma.  It was also noted that the pelvic
hematoma, though initially small, was expanding in size.

Angiography of the pelvic arteries was performed, and one
small arterial branch was embolized with gelfoam.
Neurosurgery was monitoring for evaluation of her
intracranial head bleeds.  Tight blood pressure control, as
well as glycemic control, and INR parameters were maintained
while the patient was in the Intensive Care Unit.

A follow-up head computed tomography showed no increase in
the bleeding.  The patient was awakened each day from
sedation and was found to be moving all extremities.

Neurosurgery also assisted the clearance of her cervical
spine, and a magnetic resonance imaging of the entire spine
was obtained.  Her cervical spine was subsequently cleared.

As the patient was going to the operating room for
orthopaedic repair, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] bolt was placed for intracranial
pressure monitoring on hospital day three and was taken out
on hospital day six.  The intracranial pressure was noted to
be within normal limits.  No operative intervention was found
to be needed for the patient's intracranial hemorrhage.

Orthopaedics was consulted for the patient's multiple pelvic
and lower extremity fractures.  They recommended open
reduction and internal fixation of these fractures.  This
occurred on hospital day four, as the patient's hemodynamic
status needed to be stabilized.  In addition, her
neurosurgical issues took precedence at that time.

On [**3-17**], on hospital day four, the patient went to the
operating room for open reduction/internal fixation of
bilateral tibial plateau fractures as well as open
reduction/internal fixation of the left intercondylar lateral
femur fracture.  Please see the Operative Report for full
details.  The operation occurred without any complications,
and intracranial pressure was monitored with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] bolt as
mentioned previously.

As the patient was unable to be anticoagulated given her
pelvic and intracranial bleeding, and inferior vena cava
filter was placed on hospital day three.  A week out from her
injuries, and when it was determined her intracranial
hemorrhage was stable, the patient was able to be started on
Lovenox for anticoagulation, and the inferior vena cava
filter was discontinued on [**3-26**] (on hospital day 13).

Per Orthopaedics, the patient is in [**Doctor Last Name **] braces to both
extremities on a continuous passive motion machine
bilaterally.  She was to be nonweightbearing for an extended
period of time, which will be determined specifically at her
outpatient appointment with her orthopaedic doctor (Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) in two weeks after discharge.  There was no
operative repair of her pelvic fractures.

Plastic Surgery was consulted for repair of her deep facial
lacerations which included a central forehead laceration with
tissue deficit and exposure of the rectalis muscle.  The
repair of this occurred in the operating room at the same
time that the orthopaedic procedure was taking place with
galea undermining and suturing of the laceration.  She also
had sutures placed at the bedside over her left eyelid with
good approximation and repair.

An Ophthalmology consultation was obtained given the left
periorbital swelling and asymmetry of the left pupil.  This
was thought to be due to a direct blow to the orbit region
rather than any intracranial etiology.  Ophthalmology
documented corneal abrasions, no entrapment, and recommended
prophylactic antibiotic ointments and eyedrops.

A Spinal Service consultation was obtained for evaluation of
the patient's L1 compression fracture.  The magnetic
resonance images of this region were reviewed.  The patient
was fitted for a lumbosacral brace, which she is to wear at
all times except when she is supine.

In addition, the Spinal Service was consulted for the
patient's right upper extremity weakness which was thought to
be related to her cervical stenosis and spondylosis.  This
right upper extremity weakness was brought to the doctors'
attention after the patient was extubated.  It was thought
that it is an acute-on-chronic exacerbation.  Recommendation
was made for the patient to consider cervical decompression
at a future date when she is fully recovered from this
current incident.

The Orthopaedic spine doctors spoke with the patient about
this.  As they were following her for her lumbar fracture,
they will be able to readdress this issue when she sees them
for followup.

The patient was extubated on hospital day seven; however,
this proved to be unsuccessful, and the patient needed
reintubation approximately two hours later due to coughing
and subjective feeling of being unable to breathe.  A chest
x-ray was performed, and it was thought that the patient was
too fluid overloaded to sustain spontaneous breathing.  She
was aggressively diuresed and then successfully extubated on
hospital day ten.

While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient became febrile
and was pan-cultured.  It was determined that she had a
urinary tract infection which was positive for Pseudomonas.
The patient was started on levofloxacin, and the Foley was
changed, and she became afebrile.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged in stable
condition.  At the time of discharge, she was hemodynamically
stable.  Alert and oriented times three.  Eating solid foods,
though of a soft consistency; as she is edentulous.  She is
nonweightbearing of the lower extremities and had a Foley in
place.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   To an extended care facility.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:

Chief Complaint:
Acute aortic occlusion with bilateral lower extremity ischemia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Right axillobifemoral bypass with ring PTFE graft


History of Present Illness:
This 82-year-old lady who is demented was transferred here from
the [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital with acute limb ischemia. Both legs were
mottled to the hips. The patient was in respiratory failure and
had evidence of recent myocardial infarction. A CT scan was done
because she was complaining abdominal pain and this showed the
aorta was thrombosed distal to the renal arteries. Because of
the urgent nature of the situation and after careful discussion
with the family, she was taken emergently to the operating room
for an attempt at salvaging of her limbs.

catheter or pacing
wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size.
Moderate regional
LV systolic dysfunction. TVI E/e' >15, suggesting PCWP>18mmHg.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
mid anterior -
akinetic; basal inferior - akinetic; anterior apex - akinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Focal calcifications in
aortic root.
Normal ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. Aortic
valve mass. No AR.

[1+] TR. Mild  PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Based on [**2116**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis
recommendations, the echo findings indicate a moderate risk
(prophylaxis recommended). Clinical  decisions regarding the
need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
echocardiographic data. Echocardiographic results were reviewed
by telephone with the houseofficer caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
The left and right atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall
thickness and cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional
left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal akinesis of the
basal inferior  wall and the distal half of the anterior wall.
The remaining segments contract well. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal with mild global free wall  hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
mild-moderate aortic valve stenosis. A 6mm, mobile, echodensity
is seen on the aortic side of the aortic valve, attached to the
non-coronary leaflet c/w  vegetation/thrombus/tumor. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The  tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery  systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


IMPRESSION: Mobile aortic valve echodensity c/w thrombus vs
vegetation vs. ??.  Regional left ventriuclar systolic
dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild-moderate aortic  valve stenosis.



CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval effusion, consolidation

INDICATION: 82-year-old woman status post axillary bifemoral
bypass occlusion.

COMMENTS: Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest is
reviewed, and compared with the previous study of yesterday.

The tip of the endotracheal tube is identified at the thoracic
inlet. The right jugular Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the
right main PA. The previously identified mild congestive heart
failure has been slightly improving. There is continued left
lower lobe patchy atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified.
The pacemaker leads remain in place.

IMPRESSION: Improving mild congestive heart failure with
cardiomegaly. Continued left lower lobe patchy atelectasis.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old woman with chest pain, neck pain and leg pain in
setting of htn
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
CTA: rule out dissection/PE. Has a elevated Cr. but is being
pretreated.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Chest pain, neck pain, and leg pain, in setting of
hypertension. Evaluate for dissection or pulmonary embolism.

TECHNIQUE: CTA chest, abdomen, and pelvis, with images obtained
before and after the administration of IV contrast.

COMPARISONS: None.

FINDINGS:

CTA: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism. No evidence of
dissection involving the thoracic aorta. Evaluation of the
abdominal aorta shows occlusion of the distal aorta, with
filling defect seen beginning at the level of the takeoff of the
SMAs, resulting in total occlusion of the distal abdominal
aorta. There is also filling defect seen extending into the
iliac arteries. On the delayed scan of the abdomen and pelvis,
there appears to be slight filling within the left external
iliac artery, although this is incompletely evaluated. Marked
atherosclerotic calcifications are seen involving the infrarenal
aorta. There is aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal aorta
measuring up to 3.7 x 3.2 cm in its infrarenal portion. No
definite dissection is seen. No dominant collateral vessels are
seen bypassing the area of aortic occlusion.

Note is also made that during the Smart Prep images obtained for
contrast timing evaluation, there was marked delay in the time
for contrast passage from the SVC to the pulmonary arteries and
to the ascending aorta, suggesting heart failure or markedly
decreased cardiac output.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST: There is pulmonary
vascular engorgement. There are patchy ground-glass opacities
seen throughout the lungs, with interstitial thickening as well
as engorgement of pulmonary venules. No consolidation, or
significant pleural effusion. Coronary artery calcifications are
seen, and there is a pacemaker present in the setting of marked
cardiomegaly. In addition, calcifications of the left ventricle
are seen, suggesting prior rheumatic disease.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The liver has a nodular surface
appearance, suggesting cirrhosis. The gallbladder wall appears
slightly thickened, although the gallbladder is not totally
distended, likely related to congestive failure/fluid overload.
The spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, stomach, and small bowel
are unremarkable. There is a renal cyst seen in the interpolar
portion of the right kidney, and several other cortical
low-density foci seen within both kidneys, more on the right
than on the left, which might represent small renal cysts, but
are too small to characterize on this study. The kidneys enhance
symmetrically.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There are diverticula of the
sigmoid colon. Large bowel and bladder otherwise appear
unremarkable. The bladder is decompressed.

Examination of osseous structures shows degenerative changes and
suggests short pedicles of the lower lumbar spine. Multiple
healed rib fractures are seen both on the right and on the left.
No lytic or sclerotic lesions suspicious for malignancy are
present.

Coronally and sagittally reformatted images, as well as multiple
obliquely reformatted images were also obtained. In addition,
volume rendered images as well as MIP images were created at the
workstation to better depict the involvement of thrombosis. MPR
Value: 3.

IMPRESSION:
1. Thrombosis of the distal aorta, and extending into the iliac
arteries. There are no significant collateral vessels to suggest
chronic changes. There may be some flow seen in the left
external iliac artery on the delayed images.
2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
3. Pulmonary edema and marked cardiomegaly, with delayed transit
of contrast from the SVC to the aorta.

Findings were discussed in person with the emergency department
team taking care of the patient immediately after the completion
of this examination, and a wet read report was placed on
Emergency Department Dashboard subsequently.

 INDICATION:  31-year-old man status post open reduction internal fixation of
 distal radius fracture.

 FINDINGS:  Postoperative changes status post open reduction and internal
 fixation of a comminuted intra-articular impacted distal left radius fracture
 are seen.  There is a volar plate and multiple screws with no evidence of
 hardware-related complication.  Prominent lucency between the fracture
 fragments is still visualized, with no evidence of osseous fusion.  No
 significant change in alignment compared to the previous exam is seen.
 Mineralization in the interval between the distal ulna and carpus may reflect
 chondrocalcinosis or less likely small loose bodies.  There is a fracture
 deformity at the base of the third metacarpal.  No acute fracture or
 dislocation is seen. There is soft tissue swelling.  Tissues are otherwise
 unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Status post ORIF of distal left radius fracture with unchanged alignment
 and no evidence of hardware-related complication.  No significant healing.

 2.  Fracture deformity at the base of the third metacarpal.

KNEE (2 VIEWS) BILAT  [**2132-8-14**] 7:58 PM
IMPRESSION: No fracture.

CT Torso
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intrathoracic or intra-abdominal solid
organ injury.
2. Focal hypodensity within the posterior aspect of the spleen
likely representing asymmetric perfusion.
3. There are several loops of proximal small bowel within the
left upper quadrant, which demonstrate prominant walls. Given
the lack of oral contrast, and the mechanism of injury, this
likely reflects a combination of underdistention and ingested
contents.
4. Bilateral L5 spondylolysis.

CT Maxillofacial
CT FACIAL BONES: There are fractures involving the lateral walls
of the orbits bilaterally, with two fracture lines noted on the
right. Additionally, there are comminuted fractures involving
the medial and lateral walls of the maxillary sinuses, the
ethmoid bone, and the medial and lateral pterygoid plates on the
right. There is a fracture line extending through the left side
of the hard palate. The comminuted fracture in the
posterolateral wall of the right maxillary sinus also extends to
involve the posterior inferior orbital floor at that location.
There is prolapse of muscle and fat into the right maxillary
sinus. There is a fracture through the anterior aspect of the
lesser [**Doctor First Name 362**] of the sphenoid. The ethmoid and frontal air cells
are well aerated. There are fractures through the angle of the
mandible bilaterally (comminuted on the left), with leftward
displacement of the body mandible.
Blood and fluid can be seen within both maxillary sinuses.
Additionally, there is soft tissue air adjacent to the left
lateral maxillary wall.
IMPRESSION: There are multiple facial fractures, as described
above.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There are bilateral zygomatic
arch fractures.

CT C-Spine:
IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or spondylolisthesis of the cervical vertebral
bodies is identified.
2. Bilateral mandibular rami fracture.

CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
2. Multiple facial fractures are seen, as described above. These
are better evaluated on the dedicated CT scan of the facial
bones, performed on the same day.

AP CHEST AND AP PELVIS:
IMPRESSION: No fracture or pneumothorax identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the trauma service from the ED with multiple
facial fractures, B/L mandibular fractured, and L. distal radius
fracture. Patient admitted to trauma step-down with telemetry. A
daubhoff tube was placed on [**8-16**] for tubefeeds.  Patient was
followed by orthopedics, plastics, OMFS, and neurology. On [**8-17**],
patient had 3 episodes of asymptomatic skipped heartbeats. On
[**8-22**], patient was brought to OR for ORIF of L. distal radial
fracture and ORIF of facial and mandibular fractures. Patient
was intubated via fiberoptic nasotracheal approach. There were
no complications.  Patient was transferred to the TSICU post-op.
 Given extensive facial swelling, he was intubated until [**8-25**]
when chest XRay indicated improved aeration.  He was extubated
uneventfully.  Patient was transferred to the floor on [**8-26**]. On
[**8-27**] tube feeds were stopped as he was able to take sufficient PO
intake via a straw.

He did not have witnessed seizure activity during this

 CT OF THE HEAD:

 INDICATION:  History of fall from horse with head injury.

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to MR of the head [**2185-11-3**].

 TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial images of the head were obtained without intravenous
 contrast.

 CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a longitudinally
 extensive, chronic appearing left subdural fluid collection extending over the
 frontal, temporal and parietal lobes. The width at the thickest portion is 1.5
 cm.  In comparison to the prior MRI, this collection appears somewhat larger.
 There is also a small right subdural collection over the frontal lobe, not
 significantly changed. There is mild effacement of the underlying sulci on the
 left.  Small areas of low attenuation within the inferior left frontal lobe
 are consistent with previously described brain contusions.  There is no
 evidence of acute subdural hemorrhage.  No acute intracranial or
 intraventricular hemorrhage is identified.  The ventricles and cisterns are
 normal. The grey/white matter interface is preserved.  There is 2 mm shift of
 midline supratentorial structures to the right.

 A comminuted and mildly displaced fracture extends from the cranial vertex,
 widening the sagittal suture.  This fracture has been described on multiple
 previous CTs, including the initial head CT obtained at this institution on
 [**2185-10-28**].

 IMPRESSION:
 Bilateral chronic subdural collections, without evidence of acute hemorrhage.
 The left subdural collection is somewhat larger than that seen on most recent
 MRI of [**2185-11-3**].  This finding was communicated to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 660**], at the
 time of the study, with the plan to have the patient evaluated in our
 emergency department in order to be sure no clinical issues were present that
 would warrant admission at this time.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
gentleman status post fall off a horse which was unwitnessed.
He was found on the trail with his riding helmet beside him.
He was able to give his name but was otherwise disoriented.
He was transferred to [**Hospital **] Hospital.  By report his GCS
was 14, but he had no purposeful movement.  Head CT showed
traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage with bifrontal contusions,
multiple convexity skull fractures with no significant
displacement, no more than thickness of the bone, one small
area of pneumocephalus on the base of the thalamus.

The patient was seen by the Ophthalmology Service for the
left frontal skull fracture which extended into the left
orbital roof.  No surgical intervention was needed.  His
globes were intact, and there was no need for surgical repair
of the orbital roof.  The patient was also seen by CT Surgery
for question of an esophageal [**Hospital 1994**].

The patient was intubated and sedated in the OR on Propofol.
When lightened, he was restless, unable to focus, moving all
extremities, left greater than right.  He did not open his
eyes or follow commands.  He localized with his left upper
extremity.  He had withdraw in the bilateral lower
extremities.  In the right upper extremity, he lifted
against gravity but weaker than the left.  Right pupil was 4
mm and reactive, left is irregular and nonreactive, surgical.
 He did have cornuals, gag, and cough.

The patient had repeat head CT on [**2185-10-29**], which
was unchanged from the previous day CT.  On [**2185-10-31**], the patient was awakened and attentive.  Left pupil was
surgical, right was 4.5 down to 4.0 and reactive.  He had
purposeful movements of the left greater than right.  Smile
was symmetric.

The patient had MRA/MRV to rule out stroke as the cause for
right upper extremity weakness which was negative.  It was
unclear as to the cause of the decreased movement in the
right upper extremity.  We recommended weaning from the
ventilator and weaning sedation.

The patient had repeat chest CT.  Thoracic Surgery felt there
was a low probability of an esophageal [**Last Name (LF) 1994**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] prophylaxis
antibiotics were discontinued on [**10-31**].  On [**2185-11-4**], the patient opened his eyes and followed voice.  He
occasionally followed commands.  He continued with
right-sided weakness.  Ophthalmology was consulted again who
said that he showed evidence of healing corneal abrasions.
The patient will need follow-up with outpatient
ophthalmologist after discharge.

The patient was extubated on [**11-3**] and transferred to
the regular floor on [**11-4**].  He was seen by Physical
Therapy and Occupational Therapy and found to require acute
rehabilitation prior to discharge to home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. hold for
systolic blood pressure less than 110, heart rate less than
55, Hydralazine 20 mg p.o. q.6 hours, hold for systolic blood
pressure less than 110, heart rate less than 55, Nystatin

suspension 5 cc p.o. q.i.d., Heparin 5000 U subcue q.12
hours.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient's neurologic status
improved greatly.  He was awake and alert and oriented times
[**1-16**], moving all extremities, but continued with some
right-sided weakness.  He was following commands and was out
of bed ambulating with assistance.

FOLLOW-UP:  He will need to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] on one
month with repeat head CT.  He was stable at the time of
discharge.

Service:  NB


HISTORY:  [**Known lastname 69122**] [**Known lastname 69123**] was born at 28-6/7-weeks
gestation by cesarean section for a poor biophysical profile.
The mother is a 32-year-old gravida 1, para 0 now 1 woman.
The mother's prenatal screens are blood type O-positive,
antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis
surface antigen negative, and group B Strep unknown.

The mother's previous medical history is remarkable for a
gastric bypass surgery in [**2155**], chronic lymphedema of the
left leg, chronic hypertension, asthma, depression, history
of seizures, the last 1 occurring in [**2158-3-8**], chronic
alcohol use of [**1-8**].5 pints per day at the beginning of the
pregnancy (in the 1st 4 weeks), cocaine use early in
pregnancy, smoking [**2-10**] cigarettes per day.

The maternal medications are hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
daily and labetalol 100 mg b.i.d.

This pregnancy was complicated by an abnormal quad screen,
and intrauterine growth restriction, and oligohydramnios. A
level II ultrasound done by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of maternal fetal
medicine at approximately 21 weeks showed a single umbilical
artery, a large ventricular septal defect, bilateral clubbed
feet, clenched hands, normal intraabdominal organs. The
mother elected to continue her pregnancy. An amniocentesis
showed a normal karyotype and normal FISH 22. The mother had
been anticipated being seen at the Advanced Fetal Care Clinic
at [**Hospital3 1810**], but had not been prior to the time of
delivery.

At the time of her admission to the antepartum care unit, the
guarded prognosis for this infant was discussed, and the
mother chose to continue aggressive care.

The infant emerged with decreased respiratory effort
requiring positive pressure ventilation and intubation in the
delivery room. Apgars were 4 at 1 minute and 7 at 5 minutes.

The birth weight was 615 grams. The birth length was 32 cm
and the birth head circumference was 22 cm.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The admission physical exam revealed
an extremely premature small for gestational age infant.
Anterior fontanel: Soft and flat. Red reflex: Not checked.
Palate: Intact. Neck: Supple. Clavicles: Intact. Lungs with
poor aeration bilaterally, though equal. Heart: With regular
rate and rhythm and a 1-2/6 systolic murmur at the left
sternal border, present femoral pulses. Abdomen: Soft, no
hepatosplenomegaly. Normal preterm genitalia, patent anus, no
sacral or back anomalies, stable hips. Petechiae on the skin.
Foreshortened forearms bilaterally with internally rotated
hands at the wrists. Four fingers on the left hand, 3 fingers
on the right hand, no thumbs on either hand.

NICU COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Respiratory status: The infant was
put on high-frequency ventilation. At the time of transfer,
she is on a mean airway pressure of 14, a delta P of 22
requiring 21% to 23% oxygen. Her chest x-ray shows [**8-16**] ribs
expansion. Her last venous blood gas had a pH of 7.39 and a
CO2 of 34. At that time, a wean was made on her delta P.

Cardiovascular status: She has had an intermittent murmur
since the time of admission. She did require dopamine on days
of life 1 and 2 for blood pressure support. She has been off
dopamine since [**66**]:00 hours on [**2158-9-11**].

A cardiac echocardiogram done on [**9-12**] was remarkable
for a large patent ductus arteriosus with low velocity, left-
to-right flow, trace tricuspid regurgitation, no mitral
regurgitation, normal pulmonary and systemic venous return, a
large left atrial appendage, a small pericardial effusion. No
ventricular septal defect. A patent foramen ovale versus an
atrial septal defect with left-to-right flow and
qualitatively good biventricular systolic function. Her blood
pressures prior to transfer have systolic values in the 50s,
diastolics in the 40s, and mean pressures in the 40s.

Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition status: At birth, she
weighed 615 grams. At the time of transfer, she weighs 777
grams. Her total fluids have been maintained at 80 mL per
kilogram per day. She has a double lumen umbilical venous
catheter. She is receiving parenteral nutrition of 12%
dextrose and Intralipids at 20%.

Her last electrolytes on [**2158-9-12**] were sodium 142,
potassium 2.6, chloride 104, bicarbonate 20, BUN 12,
creatinine 1.4. Electrolytes will be repeated prior to
transfer. At the time of admission, she had significant
hypoglycemia requiring multiple boluses of glucose. She has
remained euglycemic since that time and continue with IV
fluids.

Gastrointestinal status: She has passed meconium stool. She
has been treated with phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia of
prematurity from day of life 1. Continued at the time of
transfer. Her peak bilirubin on day of life 2 was total 4.1,
direct 0.4. A bilirubin on [**2158-9-12**] was total 3.8,
direct 0.7, and a follow-up bilirubin will be done prior to
transfer. Babygram continued to show dilated loop.

Hematology: At the time of admission, her hematocrit was 34.
She has received 2 packed red blood cell transfusions. Her
last hematocrit on [**2158-9-12**] was 35.8 and 1 will be
done prior to transfer. At the time of her admission, her
platelet count was 29,000. She received a platelet
transfusion with an increase in platelet count to 116,000 and
then the platelets continued to fall. She has received a
total of 3 platelet transfusions. Last transfusion was given
on [**2158-9-12**] after a platelet count of 56,000 and a
follow-up count is 191K. Her blood type is A-positive, DAT
negative.

Infectious disease status: She was started on ampicillin and
gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis risk factors.
She continues on those antibiotics at the time of transfer.
Her blood cultures do remain negative. Her gentamicin levels
after her 3rd dose were a trough of 2 and a peak of 5.7.
Those levels were being followed up after she was changed to
a 36-hour interval, and they will be rechecked prior to
transfer. At the time of admission, her white blood cell
count was 3.6. Her white count continued to drop reaching a
nadir of 0.3.

A consultation by [**Hospital3 1810**] hematology department
was done, and they recommended granulocyte colony stimulating
factor for which she has received 2 doses of 5 mcg per
kilogram subcutaneously daily [**9-11**] and [**9-12**].
Her last white count was 2.3 on [**2158-9-12**] with a
differential of 39 polys and 21 bands. This cbc was drawn before
the admisnistration of the GCSF. In addition, she has
had an elevated PTT to 78 and a fibrinogen level of 63. She
has received 2 aliquots of fresh-frozen plasma and 1 of
cryoprecipitate.

Sensory: A head ultrasound on [**2158-9-12**] was
structurally normal and showed no interventricular
hemorrhage. Hearing screening has not yet been done.

Renal: the renal US on [**2158-9-13**] showed small kidney which is
appropriate for her size. In addition ascites was noted.

Psychosocial: The mother has been involved in the infant's
NICU stay and has been checked up to date. In addition, a
toxicology screen on the maternal blood and serum at the time
of the mother's admission to the hospital on [**2158-8-14**]
was negative for drugs and alcohol.

Neurology: The infant is receiving fentanyl boluses for pain
management.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The infant is discharged in guarded
condition.

DISPOSITION:  She is transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] for
ligation of her patent ductus.

PRIMARY PEDIATRIC CARE PROVIDER:  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] not yet been
identified.

RECOMMENDATIONS AFTER DISCHARGE:  She is discharged on a NPO
status with total fluid of 100 mL per kilogram per day in a
double lumen umbilical venous catheter of 12% dextrose,
parenteral nutrition, and Intralipids.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ampicillin 90 mg IV every 12 hours.
2.  Gentamicin 1.5 mg IV every 36 hours.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 y/o M with hx of HTN, DM, ESRD on HD, HIV (CD4 560, HIV VL
116 [**8-19**]), and hx of PE on coumadin since [**2098**] presented to ED
with fevers/rigors with [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] today.

# HD Line Infection: Patient presented with fever/rigors after
[**Year (4 digits) 2286**] on the day of admission.  Right IJ HD catheter was
noted to have expressible pus in the tunnel.  The catheter site
was tender and erythemetous.  Blood Cultures were drawn in the
ED.  Patient was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric
coverage and admitted to the ICU.  Transthoracic echocardiogram
showed no signs evidence of endocarditis.  Patient was noted to
be hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the floor after
brief (< 1 day) ICU course.  After arrival to the floor, patient
was initially continued on Vancomycin and Zosyn until cultures
returned as MSSA.  ID was consulted at this time.  Patient was
started on Nafcillin 2g IV q4 hours.  Transesophogeal
Echocardiogram showed no signs of endocarditis.  Patient
remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable on the Nafcillin.
On [**2111-9-26**] (hospital day 5), patient was taken to IR for
re-siting of HD line.  Left IJ HD catheter was successfully
placed and infected Right IJ catheter was removed with no
complications. At this time, Nafcillin was changed to Cefazolin
qHD for convenience of the patient after discharge.  Patient
remained hemodynamically stable after treatment of cefazolin
with no signs of worsening infection or seeding of infection to
secondary sites.  Daily surveillance blood cultures were
negative (after initial [**3-14**] on [**9-21**]) at time of discharge.
Patient was discharged home after [**Month/Year (2) 2286**], afebrile.  Cefazolin
is to be continued for total 4-week course from Line removal
([**2111-9-26**]).

# ESRD on HD: Mr. [**Known lastname 94523**] has ESRD, recieving HD on MWF schedule.
He was previously on the transplant list, however due to
non-compliance, he was taken off the transplant list earlier
this year.  Patient's MWF [**Known lastname 2286**] schedule was continued during
the admission.  Right IJ HD catheter was removed and Left IJ
Catheter placed as above.  Sevelamer was started while patient
was inpatient and continued on discharge.  No follow-up arranged
as he is seen by his [**Known lastname **] in [**Known lastname 2286**] clinic.

# Hypertension: Poorly controlled, history of malignant htn. On
admission, Nifedipine CR 60 mg PO BID was continued.  On
transfer to the floor, blood pressure was noted to be elevated
and he was started on hydralazine 10 mg PO q8h.  Blood pressures
were better controlled, but decision was made to switch from
hydralazine to labetalol and attempt was made to titrate this
up.  Patient had periodic emesis (baseline for him) and
frequently refused his medications.  Due to this, systolic blood
pressure occasionally reached 200-220, and was given hydralazine
IV on a prn basis.  Prior to discharge, labetalol was
discontinued and Toprol XL 100mg [**Hospital1 **] was started (patient states
this was his home dose).  BP was well controlled on day of
discharge.

# EKG changes: ED consulted cards in ED for isolated V2 STE
which improved with slower rate. Trop positive but with ESRD it
is not higher than prior values. Low likelihood of ACS
especially given lack of CP.  Patient was monitored over
admission and had no signs or symptoms of ACS.

# HIV: CD5 560 in [**8-19**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] as an outpatient.
HAART was continued while Mr. [**Known lastname 94523**] was admitted to the
hospital.  Infectious Disease was consulted due to his high
grade MSSA bacteremia.  Mr. [**Known lastname 94523**] was counseled on the
importance of medication adherance during his admission.  His
outpatient ID doctor also recommended to stop his ARVs on
discharge given that he had been refusing some of these
medications in the hospital and thought that stopping them at
once would help prevent resistance patterns.  He is to follow-up
with ID after discharge.

# Diabetes - History of diabetes, likely type 1, continued NPH
while in hospital, but on reduced doses.  Patient became
hypoglycemic overnight due to reduced appetite and evening NPH
discontinued, but AM NPH maintained due to type I history.
Patient discharged home on previous regimen with Regular insulin
sliding scale.

# Cough: Wheezy and rhonchorous on exam, no cxr infiltrates,
appeared slightly hyperinflated, no documented PFTs but with
smoking history COPD is possible.
Given Albuterol prn.

# h/o PE: Diagnosed by CT in [**2109-1-10**].  Currently on
coumadin as outpatient, but found to be sub-therapeutic on
admission.  Patient also noted to have IJ clot on U/S, so placed
on heparin gtt.  Heparin held for IR procedure.  Prior to
discharge, coumadin was restarted with 5mg loading dose then
placed on home dose of 2 mg qday.  INR was therapeutic on
discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital because of fever and chills. You were
found to have an infection at the site of your [**Year (4 digits) 2286**]
catheter. Your [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] catheter was removed and a new one was
inserted.  You received IV antibiotics in the hospital for the
treatment of your infection.  You will need to receive 4 weeks
of antibiotic therapy to treat your infection--your antibiotics
will be given to you at your [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] sessions.  During your
hospital admission, your blood pressure was elevated and was
treated with additional medication to lower it.  It is important
that you follow-up with your primary care physician,
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] and infectious disease (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]

Service:  Neonatology

IDENTIFICATION:  [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] is a now 33 day old former 30 6/7
weeks premature infant who remains hospitalized at the [**Hospital6 1760**] Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
with issues of apnea of prematurity and feeding immaturity.
[**Known lastname **] was born at the [**Hospital6 **] Hospital on [**2167-3-29**], transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] secondary to bed
space issues and subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2167-4-9**], again for bed
space issues.  This summary covers hospitalization at [**Hospital6 1760**] through [**2167-5-1**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname **] who was admitted to
the [**Hospital6 256**] Neonatal Intensive
Care Unit at day of life #10 as a former 30 [**5-8**] week
premature infant transferred from [**Hospital3 1810**].  She
was born on [**3-29**] as the 1370 gm product of a 30 [**5-8**] week
gestation to a 35 year old gravida 1, para 1 mother following
progressive preterm labor unresponsive to magnesium sulfate.
Mother was pretreated with antibiotics and partially treated
with Betamethasone.  Her prenatal laboratory data are notable
for blood type A positive and Group B Streptococcus unknown.
Infant emerged vigorous with Apgars of 6 and 7 and a
birthweight of 1370 gm.  Initial physical examination was
notable for a birthweight of 1370 and a premature infant
nondysmorphic appearing without respiratory distress.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Respiratory - The infant was initially
placed on CPAP secondary to apnea and shallow breathing.  The
infant was not thought to have hyaline membrane disease by
clinical examination or x-ray.  The infant did require
intubation secondary to marked apnea; the infant remained
intubated for less than 24 hours and subsequently was placed
back on CPAP.  The infant was taken off of CPAP on day 4 of
life and transitioned to nasal cannula flow.  At the time of
transfer to [**Hospital6 256**] the infant
was clinically stable on nasal cannula flow at 100 cc of 21
to 30% oxygen with occasional apnea, bradycardiac spells.
Over the course of the hospitalization at the [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient has continued to
have difficulties with apnea of prematurity with spells
varying in frequency and severity.  The patient has been on
and off of nasal cannula flow as well as CPAP secondary to
these spells.  The infant was placed back on CPAP on [**4-15**],
day of life #17 and then was transitioned again to nasal
cannula or room air on [**4-28**], day of life #30.  However, the
patient had to be placed on CPAP on [**4-30**], day of life #32
secondary to increased spells again.  The infant has been
maintained on caffeine at 8 to 10 mg/kg/day of caffeine
citrate with occasional boluses.  The infant does appear
comfortable at rest with well aerated breathsounds and no
oxygen requirement, so it is not thought that the patient has
significant baseline lung disease.  A chest x-ray performed
on [**5-1**], reveals moderate to normal lung volumes with
evidence of mild lung disease of prematurity.  The patient
has not received any diuretic therapy.

2.  Cardiovascular - The patient has been largely
hemodynamically stable throughout hospitalization.  The
patient did receive a normal saline bolus times one on day #1
of life.  A murmur was heard at approximately day 7 to 8 of
life that has been persistent.  This is a soft systolic
murmur.  Echocardiogram on approximately day #14 of life
revealed a structurally normal heart without a patent ductus
arteriosus, but did reveal peripheral pulmonic stenosis.

3.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was
initially maintained on parenteral nutrition and begun on
enteral feeds by day of life #3.  These were advanced without
difficulty.  At the time of this dictation the patient has
been tolerating 30 cal/oz breastmilk supplemented with ProMod
at 150 cc/kg/day without issues.  Urine and stool output are
normal and the patient is gaining weight.  Weight at birth
was 1370 gm, weight on the day of admission [**4-9**] was 1300 gm
and the weight on [**5-1**] is 1855 gm.

4.  Gastrointestinal - The patient was treated with
phototherapy for approximately three days for mild
physiologic hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity.

5.  Infectious disease - The patient received 48 hours of
ampicillin and gentamicin for the first two days of life,
pending clinical course and negative blood cultures.  A
repeat sepsis evaluation was performed on day of life #25 and
again on day of life 33 secondary to the increased spells; in
both cases the complete blood counts were reassuring and no
antibiotics were given.  Both blood cultures subsequently
became negative.

6.  Heme - The patient has never been transfused.  Hematocrit
on day of life #25, [**4-23**] was found to be 26.8.  Previous
hematocrit was 29 on [**4-20**] with a reticulocyte count of
5.1%.  Given the anemia and the impressive apnea of
prematurity several discussions were held with the family and
it was decided to begin a two week course of Epogen.  This
was begun on [**4-24**] along with supplemental folate and extra
Fer-In-[**Male First Name (un) **].  Hematocrit on [**4-28**] was 27.9 with a
reticulocyte count of 5.9 and hematocrit on [**5-1**] was 28.
It is planned the Epogen should continue until approximately
[**5-7**]; after discontinuation of the Epogen, Fer-In-[**Male First Name (un) **]
should be reduced to normal dosing and Folate should be
discontinued.

7.  Neurological - The patient has had a normal neurological
examination throughout admission.  Head ultrasound on day of
life #7 was normal.  Repeat ultrasound on day of life #26 was
also normal.  The patient received an ophthalmologic
evaluation on [**4-22**] which revealed immature retinas in Zone
2 bilaterally with follow up recommended in three weeks.
Hearing screening has not yet been performed at the time of
this dictation.

CONDITION AT TIME OF DICTATION:  At the time of this
dictation the patient is overall doing well.  The patient is
presently on CPAP of 5 in room air secondary to apnea of
prematurity.  Also on CPAP the patient does have occasional
spells but only has rare spells on CPAP.  The patient is
hemodynamically stable with a murmur by examination that is
thought to be peripheral pulmonic stenosis as documented by
echocardiogram.  The patient is tolerating 30 cal/oz of
breastmilk with supplemental ProMod in 150 cc/kg/day with
normal urine and stool and appropriate weight gain.  The
patient continues on Epogen for anemia.

MEDICATIONS:  Fer-In-[**Male First Name (un) **], Folate, Epogen, Vitamin E, Caffeine

DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Prematurity at 30 6/7 weeks
2.  Apnea of prematurity

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mental status change, shortness of breath

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 53-year-old
female with a history of bipolar disorder, diabetes mellitus,
who was referred from [**State 350**] Mental Health for
accidentally taking two 900 mg tablets of lithium the night
before presentation.  The patient reported one day history of
vomiting and shortness of breath as well as body aches.  The
patient was unable to give an elaborate history beyond that
of her concern that she had had too much lithium.  The
patient had revealed that she had taken too much lithium in
the past, and felt much the same as she did when she
presented.  The patient had no history of chest pain, fever,
cough, but did note shortness of breath especially with
climbing stairs.

In the Emergency Department, a Foley catheter was placed,
drawing 50 cc of urine.  An arterial blood gas was performed,
revealing a pH of 7.31, with a PCO2 of 60 and a PAO2 of 68.
Oxygen saturations were in the mid-80s.  Chest x-ray showed
bilateral basilar opacities with pulmonary vascular
congestion.  The Medical Intensive Care Unit was called for
assessment for invasive monitoring of the patient and to
monitor waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]  mental status in the setting of
elevated lithium level.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Bipolar disorder
2.  Morbid obesity
3.  Hypothyroidism
4.  Sleep apnea
5.  Diabetes mellitus

MEDICATIONS:   Lithium 600 mg every morning and 900 mg every
evening, Trazodone 100 mg by mouth daily at bedtime,
Synthroid, Glucophage, Glucotrol, lasix, Accupril and
hydrochlorothiazide.

ALLERGIES:   Stelazine, Norpramin

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient is divorced, lives with her
fiance.  The patient admits to a brief smoking history as a
teenager.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 99, heart rate 70s to
80s, blood pressure 134/86, oxygen saturation 80% supine and
92% sitting up.  On general examination, the patient was an
alert, obese female, in mild distress.  The patient was
oriented to place, date and situation.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat examination revealed pupils equal, round and
reactive to light, extraocular movements intact.  Thorax
revealed bibasilar rales to the mid-lung fields.  Cardiac
examination revealed regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2,
and a II/VI systolic murmur.  Abdominal examination revealed
an abdomen that was soft, obese, nontender, nondistended,
with normal bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed 1+
peripheral edema.  Neurological examination revealed a
patient that was alert, somewhat inattentive.  The patient
was tremulous.  There were scattered myoclonic jerks.  The
patient had 3+ reflexes throughout, with one to two beats of
clonus at the ankles.

LABORATORY DATA:   The patient had a sodium of 134, potassium
4.5, chloride 99, bicarbonate 30, BUN 52, creatinine 3.4 with
a baseline of 0.9, and glucose of 77.  The patient had a
lithium level of 2.6.  The patient had a white blood cell
count of 14.9 with a hematocrit of 34.7 and platelets of 268.
Serum toxicology screen was negative for aspirin, ETOH,
acetaminophen, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and tricyclic
antidepressants.  Urinalysis revealed positive nitrites, 3+
protein, moderate blood, [**5-13**] red blood cells, and [**10-23**]
white blood cells.  An initial CK was 20.

Chest x-ray:  Cardiomegaly with congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm, normal axis,
nonspecific ST/T wave changes in V1 and AVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient is a 53-year-old female with a
history of bipolar disorder, diabetes mellitus, who presented
with a one day history of vomiting and shortness of breath as
well as a history of ingestion of 1800 mg of lithium the
evening before presentation.  The patient was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit to monitor her waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
mental status as well as her ability to maintain her airway.

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient presented with acute on chronic
respiratory acidosis.  It was suspected that the acute
component was likely related to CNS depression with lithium
overdose.  The chronic component appeared to be secondary to
her obesity and obstructive sleep apnea.  The patient was
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for supplemental
oxygen, monitoring of her respiratory status, and possible
need for intubation.  The patient was also suspected to be in
congestive heart failure, and was diuresed as well.  The
patient did require a brief intubation secondary to a neck
hematoma that developed after central line attempt.  This was
done prophylactically for airway protection.  The patient was
quickly extubated as the hematoma resolved.  The patient was
also subsequently found to have a pneumonia and was
successfully treated with a ten day course of levofloxacin
and vancomycin.  The patient showed improvement in her oxygen
saturation over the course of the admission, and was
transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the regular
Medicine floor on [**2125-10-24**].  She routinely had an
oxygen saturation of 93 to 95% on room air.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction by serial CKs.

3.  Neurologic:  Patient with changes in mental status,
likely secondary to lithium overdose.  Her lithium level was
elevated to 2.6.  She was obtunded, tremulous, with mild
ataxia.  She had barbiturates present in her urine.
Toxicology was consulted and recommended holding all of the
patient's psychotropic medications as well as recommending
dialysis for removal of lithium.  The patient was started on
hemodialysis secondary to increased lethargy, worsening
acid/base status, and the presence of toxic levels of
lithium.  She tolerated this well.  The patient's lithium
level steadily trended downwards to the point of being
undetectable.  The patient's mental status gradually returned
to her baseline.  Psychiatry had been consulted and
recommended that there was no acute indication for
pharmacotherapy of her bipolar disorder.  They recommended
Haldol and Ativan for agitation.  The patient had infrequent
episodes of agitation in the evening, requiring Haldol.

4.  Renal:  The patient presented with oliguric acute renal
failure after lithium overdose.  This was thought to be
secondary to acute tubular necrosis related to hypovolemia as
well as lithium toxicity.  The patient required hemodialysis
both to remove toxic levels of lithium as well as for
worsening acid/base status.  A first attempt at a
hemodialysis line placement resulted in a right neck
hematoma.  A second line placement attempt led to a femoral
artery puncture which required Vascular Surgery repair.  The
patient became hemodynamically unstable, requiring a short
interval on pressors secondary to this complication.  The
patient returned quickly to hemodynamic stability.  The
patient's creatinine was elevated on presentation and
required ongoing hemodialysis.  However, the patient
gradually showed improvement in her creatinine, which came
down to 1.3.  The patient also began to have excellent urine
output, up to 1500 cc/day.  At that point, the Renal service
did not feel that the patient needed ongoing hemodialysis,
nor was it felt that she needed to continue to receive
erythropoietin.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had a nasogastric tube
placed upon admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
She received tube feeds for the initial Intensive Care Unit
stay.  However, the patient began to have evidence of
increasing abdominal tenderness with an elevated lipase,
suggesting pancreatitis.  The patient had an abdominal CT
which was negative for pancreatic pseudocyst or for
pancreatic inflammation.  However, the patient continued to
have an increasing lipase and was therefore placed on bowel
rest with nasogastric tube placement.  The patient's white
blood cell count was likewise elevated.  However, the
patient's lipase gradually decreased while on bowel rest, as
did her white blood cell count.  Her abdominal tenderness
resolved, and she was gradually started on sips of clear
fluids.  She tolerated this well.  The patient had a swallow
study in the Intensive Care Unit, which revealed some
evidence of aspiration.  She did not have any evidence of
aspiration as her diet was advanced.  She was eventually able
to tolerate a full [**Doctor First Name **] diet.

6.  Endocrine:  Patient with history of diabetes, on oral
hypoglycemics at home.  The patient was started on NPH and
regular insulin sliding scale in the Intensive Care Unit.
This was continued as the patient was transferred to the
floor.  The patient had finger stick blood sugars checked
four times a day.  She showed excellent glycemic control
while in-hospital.

7.  Hematology:  Patient with evidence of anemia upon
presentation.  She had further blood loss secondary to a
complicated central line placement.  Her hematocrit
eventually stabilized.  Because of the possibility of chronic
renal insufficiency, the patient was given erythropoietin.
Her hematocrit was monitored closely while in the hospital.
She did have evidence of resolving normocytic anemia, which
was likely not multifactorial.  The patient may require an
outpatient colonoscopy at some point to evaluate possible
gastrointestinal losses.

8.  Infectious Disease:  The patient presented with evidence
of urinary tract infection and was initially treated with
ciprofloxacin.  The patient later was found to have a
pneumonia, which was successfully treated with a ten day
course of levofloxacin and vancomycin.  The patient was
afebrile, with a gradually normalizing white blood cell count
upon transfer to the general medical floor.  The patient's
elevated white blood cell count was attributed to
pancreatitis, and as her lipase resolved, her white blood
cell count also decreased.  She was carefully monitored for
any signs of infection.  She did have evidence of funguria on
a repeat urine culture.  The patient had a Foley, which was
changed.  Urine culture was rechecked after the Foley change.
This urine culture was pending at the time of this discharge
summary.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   Synthroid 100 mcg by mouth once
daily, vitamin E 400 units by mouth once daily, Protonix 40
mg by mouth once daily, heparin subcutaneously 5000 units

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby boy [**Known lastname 70783**] is the 2.04 kg
product of a 34 and [**1-24**] week gestation born to a 36-year-old
G3, P2, now 3 mother.

Prenatal screens - blood type A negative, antibody negative,
RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, hepatitis surface antigen
negative, and GBS unknown. This pregnancy was reportedly
unremarkable with normal AFP and ultrasound. No
amniocentesis. Mother presented this morning with pre-PROM at
approximately 5 a.m. Mother was admitted for induction of
labor. Labor progressed gradually although recurrent fetal
decelerations required discontinuation of Pitocin and
treatment with amnioinfusion via IUPC. The infant was
eventually delivered by stat cesarean section for prolonged
fetal decelerations. After placement of spinal anesthesia,
mother was found to be fully dilated and progressed to
forceps assisted vaginal delivery. Nuchal cord
was present.

At delivery the infant emerged with moderate tone and
spontaneous cry requiring only drying and stimulation. Apgars

Post-op CXR ([**5-9**]):  Satisfactory postoperative appearance with a
faint right basilar density.

Chest CT ([**5-15**]):  Minimal hickening at the distal esophagus as
it crosses the diaphragm. No definite peri-esophageal fluid
collection is seen; no
significant fluid collection is seen within the esophagus.

CXR ([**5-16**]):  The heart size and mediastinal contours are
unchanged. Two
left-sided chest tubes are in unchanged position. A tiny left
apical
pneumothorax is stable in appearance. A small left-sided pleural
effusion and atelectasis within the left lower lobe are
unchanged. No new opacities are seen within the lungs.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was transferred from [**Hospital 26380**] Hospital with a gastrgraffin
swallow and CT suggesting an esophageal rupture.  His initial
constellation of syptoms began with wretching after a meal, and
included vomitting and feeling steak stuck in his throat,
followed by hematemesis and the acute onset of chest, abd as
well as back pain.  He was taken emergently to the OR in the
morning of [**2110-5-9**] for the above procedure.  The operation itself
was without complication or finding necessitate a change in
preop Dx; however, during intra-op EGD, an esophageal flap was
identified.  A G and J tube were placed intraoperatively for
considerations of post-op management.  Post-operatively, he was
transferred to the SICU intubated, and stated on
Amp/Levo/Flagyl.  He was extubated on POD#1, and started on
jejunal tube feeds on POD#2, and an ENT consult was obtained for
the esophageal web.  He remained stable in the SICU and was
transferred to the floor on POD#3.  He tolerated his tube feeds
well, and the chest tubes were kept to sxn until POD#5; CVL was
also removed n POD#5.  Of note, upon his transfer to the floor,
the J and G tubes were reversed, such that he was getting TFs in
the G and the J was to gravity; the situation was recognized and
corrected with no apparent sequelae (the NGT and was removing
all feeds from stomach).  The NGT was removed by pt on POD#7,
but G-tube remained to gravity, no issues.  On POD#8, the chest
tubes were put to air seal, all PO meds were changed to the
J-tube and he was freely ambulating and tolerating TFs at goal;
also on this day, his intra-operative cultures came back + for
Pseudomonas, and he was transitioned from Levo to cipro.  CM was
able to obtain home services for his feeds and drains.  On
POD#11, pt was considered stable for discharge home, and all
necessary services were arranged.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:81y/o F with COPD- chronically vent dependant, HTN, p/w
altered mental status and difusse body twitching.

1. Altered mental status:
Was likely multifactorial given that she had a pneumonia, was
extremely anemic and was on multiple medications that could
cause confusion. We started treatment with broad spectrum
antibiotics and on day 2 of admission was narrowed down to
Levofloxacin 250mg. On day two of admission, patient was given
her morning medications which included neurontin, celexa and
clonidine. Within 40min she became lethargic and very difficult
to arouse. She had been on trach collar at the time and was
immediately placed back on mechanical ventilation given the
thinking that she may have become hypercarbic. Oxygenation was
100% the entire time. Team tried to gas patient but refused and
would not allow any blood draws. Nurse then brought the
medications to our attention and medications were discontinued.
Her mentation improved and maintained itself throughout the day.
She was also transfused one unit of packed red blood cells. The
infection, anemia and medications all contributed to her change
in mental status but the medication seemed to be the likely
culprit. Her Lfts were normal, her ecg did not have any evidence
of MI, enzymes were flat, ua was normal, not uremic, her gas was
not far from her baseline, glucose normal as well as ca/mg/phos,
no evidence of seizure. The celexa, neurontin and clonidine
should not be restarted.
.
2. Myoclonus: iron defficiency vs. hypercarbia vs. medications.
Patient was transfused with one unit of red cells, medications
were stopped as above and the infection is being treated.
Unclear as to which intervention stopped the myoclonus but it
has gone.
.
3. COPD/asthma: c/w fluticasone and combivent.
.
4. HTN: Norvasc and clonidine were stopped. HCTZ was restarted
on discharge. Patient normotensive, norvasc not restarted.
.
5. Anemia:
-has chronic anemia, on aranesp. Patient transfused two unit of
packed red blood cells. Hct stable.
.
6. Acute renal insufficiency:
-NS fluid hydration was given, Urine lytes showed FeUrea: >50%.
Cr was stable x3, ? whether she had medication induced ATN or
whether this is chronic renal insufficiency. UOP was normal.
.
7. Thrombocytopenia:
-platelets stable. Chronic thrombocytopenia. Follow up with pcp
for further work up.

Approved: MON [**2142-11-19**] 7:16 PM


Brief Hospital Course:
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 69**],
Ortho-Trauma, neurosurgery, thoracic surgery and plastic surgery
consults were obtained for multiple injuries. She underwent
surgical repair of open right tibia/fibula fracture with
external fixation on [**2142-11-10**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7376**]. She recovered in
the PACU, remained intubated, and was transferred to Trauma
Surgical Intensive Care Unit. On [**2142-11-11**] she underwent repair
of tracheal rupture by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], which included placement
of 3 chest tubes and a cervical collar. The patient remained
intubated and recovered well in the PACU. She was then
transferred  back to Trauma Surgical Intensive Care unit.

Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy were consulted on
[**2142-11-11**], and have followed her throughout her admission.

She was extubated on [**2142-11-12**]. Gentamycin and Cefazolin were
started post-operatively, as well as anticoagulation. A PICC
line was placed by interventional radiology for intravenous
access. Acute pain service was consulted and an epidural was
placed. Her pain was controlled through epidural analgesia and
intravenous Dialudid via patient controlled analgesia. PCA
dialudid was continued until [**2142-11-23**] when she was transitioned
to oral dilaudid, which she has tolerated well.

The tracheal injury prohibited further intubation for surgical
ORIF of Tibula/fibula fracture. On [**2142-11-13**], spinal clearance
was obtained. On [**2142-11-14**] 2 chest tubes were removed, and the
remaining chest tube was left to water seal.

On [**2142-11-19**] she recieved ORIF of the right tibula/fibula under
spinal anesthesia, removal of ex-fix and placement of wound vac
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Plastic surgery is consulted regarding the
wound vac of the right lower extremity, and for closure of the
leg flap. She is projected to have closure of the flap during
the middle of the week of Decemeber 11th. On [**2142-11-20**] she was
touch down weight bearing on RLE and the [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was d/c by
thoracic surgery.  The vac dressing remained in place.  ON
[**2142-11-21**], she had her PICC line TPAd with success.  On [**2142-11-22**]
orthopedics changed the VAC dressing and she continued to wait
for a flap.  On [**2142-11-23**] the PCA was stopped and she tolerated
oral pain medication well.  On [**2142-11-24**], there were no issues.
On [**2142-11-25**], the vac was changed again by orthopedics.  On
[**2142-11-26**], she was preoped for flap placement on RLE.  PT saw her
as well and thought patient had great rehab potential when
eligable.  The patient ended up going to the OR on [**2142-11-28**] for
RLE Gastro flap with full thickness skin graft.  Please see
operative note for full details.  She had no intra or
postoperative complications.  On [**2142-11-29**], there were no major
issues as her pain was well controlled.  The JP drain put out
29cc of serosang fluid.  On [**2142-11-30**], the [**Last Name (un) 32019**] remained in
place the JP continued to drain serosanguinous fluid.  On
[**2142-12-1**], she there were major issues and her pain was well
controlled with po tylenol.  She remained on bed rest and on
[**2142-12-3**], we changed the dressing.  The wound was intact and
looked good.  Occupational therapy saw here on [**2142-12-4**] and
recommended OT and rehab 3 hours per day 5-7 days/week to
maximize patient function. She also stared a dangle protocol at
5 minutes TID and the JP remained in.  ON [**2142-12-5**], we changed
the dressing again and took out the JP.  She was advanced to a
15 minute dangle protocol TID and was due for discharge to
Spaling facility this afternoon.

 INDICATION:  Burkitt's lymphoma, status post chemotherapy.

 COMPARISON:  [**2100-10-28**] CT of the chest, and CT abdomen [**2100-11-27**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
 were obtained following the administration of oral and intravenous contrast.

 INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  150 mL of Optiray without adverse effect.

 CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.  Small mediastinal
 lymph nodes are evident in the pretracheal region, which do not meet criteria
 for pathologic enlargement.  Again seen at the right hilum is a 1.7 x 2.0 cm
 lymph node containing some calcification.  This calcification appears
 unchanged.  The left hilum appears unremarkable.  There is no pericardial
 adenopathy.  Calcified nodule in the left upper lobe likely represents a
 granuloma and is unchanged.  Second calcified nodule in the right middle lobe
 is also unchanged and likely represents a granuloma.

 ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, pancreas, gallbladder, and adrenal glands
 are within normal limits.  Again seen is a low-density mass within the spleen
 measuring 7.7 x 7.0 cm (previously 8.9 x 7.6 cm).  A decreased amount of fluid
 is noted adjacent to the splenic tip, with diminished enhancement within the
 rim compared to the previous study.  Cyst at the mid pole of the left kidney
 appears unchanged.  A small low-density lesion at the mid pole of the right
 kidney is also likely a simple cyst, but too small to definitively
 characterized.  Again seen in the celiac region is an amorphous soft tissue
 density mass measuring approximately 4.3 x 5.0 cm (previously 4.3 x 6.0 cm).
 No new soft tissue density masses are evident.  The opacified loops of bowel
 are normal in caliber.

 PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder, prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and
 pelvic loops of bowel are within normal limits.  There is no inguinal or deep
 pelvic lymphadenopathy.  There is no free pelvic fluid.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Patchy focus of sclerosis within the right femoral neck is
 stable and of uncertain etiology, possibly representing a small bone infarct.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  Decrease in size of splenic mass and periaortic/celiac lymph node
 conglomeration.
 2)  Lymph node at the right hilum, slightly larger than on the previous exam.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old man
with a history of alcohol abuse who presented on [**2124-11-2**] with
lethargy, abnormal labs, dehydration and a low blood
pressure.  The patient has long history of alcohol abuse with
question liver disease.  He also had a prior GI bleed in the
past but is not known to have varices.  He initially
presented to [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency
Room on [**2124-10-30**] with complaints of weakness, trouble
ambulating and requesting detox placement.  He was discharged
to [**Hospital1 **] for detox.  Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 **], labs were
drawn which revealed severely elevated liver function tests.
This included an AST of 99, ALT 32, alkaline phosphatase 496,
total bilirubin 16.4, albumin 1.6.  It also showed that he
had a hematocrit of 22.2.

The patient was managed for approximately 1?????? days with a CIWA
scale, received 1-2 doses of Serax.  He was also started on
Levaquin for a question of pneumonia.  However, on the
evening of [**2124-11-1**], the patient was found to be hypotensive
and more lethargic.  He was then transferred back to the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Room for further
evaluation and management.

In the Emergency Room, a central line was placed and he was
given aggressive IV fluid and rehydration including
intravenous potassium chloride and potassium phosphate.  A
rectal was guaiac negative and NG lavage was also negative
for GI bleed.  A diagnostic paracentesis was performed which
yielded only about 10-15 cc of straw colored fluid.  This
fluid was negative for suggestion of spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis.  The patient had a blood pressure in the 70-80
range systolic and was felt to be too unstable for the
general medical floor and was transferred to the MICU on the
[**Hospital Ward Name **].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Alcohol abuse with apparent liver
disease.  History of withdrawal with delirium tremens but no
history of seizures.  History of GI bleed, presumably
secondary to gastritis.  Prostate cancer status post
resection [**12/2121**].  Pancreatitis.  Chronic hypocalcemia.  Status
post fracture and open reduction and internal fixation of his
left arm.  Coronary artery disease.  Cardiac catheterization
[**11-29**] showed an EF of 50%, mild to moderate single vessel
disease of the left circumflex artery, 50% stenosing lesion
was noted at the mid section of the artery.  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS:  On transfer from [**Hospital1 **], Multivitamin,
Folate, Thiamine, Protonix, calcium carbonate, magnesium
oxide, Levaquin 500 mg, Lasix, Serax.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  He is a retired
telephone repairman.  He has a history of alcohol abuse,
drinking at least 1?????? cups of brandy a day.  His last drink
was reportedly on [**2124-10-30**].  He also smoked ?????? pack per day
times 30 years.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.1, pulse 88-99, blood
pressure 70/42-117/64, respiratory rate 26, O2 saturation 99%
on four liters nasal cannula.  The patient is a cachectic
elderly African American male in no acute distress.  He is
lethargic.  He is alert and oriented times two.  HEENT:
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation,
there is positive scleral icterus.  His oropharynx is clear.
Neck is supple.  Chest, bibasilar crackles without wheezing
anteriorly.  Cardiovascular exam is regular rate and rhythm,
no murmurs are appreciated.  Abdomen, positive bowel sounds,
very distended.  Liver edge palpable about 5 cm below the
right costal margin and nontender.  Tympanic abdomen.  Guaiac
negative rectal exam.  Extremities, trace edema in both feet.
Neuro exam, alert and oriented times two but lethargic.  Does
not cooperate with full neuro exam but moves all extremities.

red cells, few teardrops, reticulocytes, no schistocytes
seen.  EKG, atrial tachycardia at 115, normal axis, short PR
interval, long QTC, superior T wave, T wave inversions in V1,
biphasic in leads V2 through V3, T wave flattening in 3, L.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted for management of
his apparent fulminant liver failure.  CT scan of his abdomen
was performed after admission.  This revealed bilateral
pleural effusions, diffuse fatty liver, no intra or extra
hepatic ductal dilatation, patent portal and hepatic veins,
diffuse colonic thickening which appears to be consistent
with pancolitis with some involvement of the terminal ileum.
Gallbladder shows some stones and sludging but no wall
thickening.  There is a small amount of fluid around the tail
of the pancreas with no overt radiographic evidence of
pancreatitis.  Diverticula were also noted.  There is a
moderate amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  There is not an
overt amount of ascites fluid.  There is increased
attenuation in the right lobe of the liver.

The liver service was consulted as well as the surgical
service to comment on the patient's liver failure as well as
abdominal distention.  The liver service felt that this was
most likely consistent with a picture of fulminant alcoholic
hepatitis.  They did note that it is not uncommon to see
mildly elevated transaminases in the presence of severely
elevated alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin.  There
were initial discussions regarding performing an MRCP vs an
ERCP.  By [**2124-11-3**] the patient's amylase and lipase had
decreased significantly.  At that point, the liver service
suggested holding off on performing an MRCP.  It was also
felt that the patient would likely not tolerate an MRCP given
his history of claustrophobia.  If he required sedation for
the procedure, he likely would have required intubation for
airway management.

The liver service also felt that ERCP was likely not
indicated in his case regardless given the severity of his
liver failure.  It was felt that if he had the unfortunate
complication of pancreatitis status post ERCP, that his
overall mortality would be unacceptably high.

Pentoxifylline was started initially to prevent the
development of renal failure given his liver failure.
However, this was later stopped due to the question of
possible sepsis.

The surgical service recommended no surgical intervention as
an option at this time.  They felt that the increase in the
bilirubin, and the bowel wall thickening appeared to be
related to his extensive liver failure.  They felt no
surgical intervention was indicated given his overall
clinical picture.

The patient was hemodynamically stable during his initial
stay in the MICU.  He was transferred to the floor on
[**2124-11-4**].  However, on [**2124-11-5**] the patient became increasingly
confused and his temperature was noted to drop to 90.
Because of his confusion and severe hypothermia, he was
returned to the MICU service for further evaluation as he
appeared to be rapidly deteriorating.  Also, the patient's
blood pressure had again dropped to the 70 range.  He
received treatment with IV fluids, and antibiotics were
continued for broad coverage of bowel flora.  Antibiotic
regimen which had been started on initial admission to the
MICU included Ampicillin, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl.  His
Pentoxifylline was discontinued given the concern for the
development of sepsis at this point.  The patient's liver
function tests showed a mixed picture of improvement vs
deterioration.  His total bilirubin gradually was decreasing
after peaking in the 24 range.  Meanwhile his amylase and
lipase had again returned to the 200 range after initial
improvement.  His abdominal distention was worsening and
plain radiographs of the abdomen showed very distended loops
of bowel.  There was no overt evidence of obstruction.  The
patient was continuing to pass stool.  The Metronidazole was
changed to an alternating dose between po and IV given the
concern for C. diff colitis.  There was no radiographic
evidence of toxic megacolon.

On [**2124-11-6**] the patient became hemodynamically unstable with
blood pressures dropping to the 60's and 70's systolic range.
He was emergently intubated for airway protection given his
mental status, and he was started on pressors with Dopamine
initially.  On the ventilator, the patient was
hyperventilated to attempt to compensate for his severe
metabolic acidosis.  His serum PH ranged between 7.2 and 7.3
on the ventilator.

On [**2124-11-7**], the patient continued to deteriorate from a
hemodynamic standpoint requiring the addition of two more
pressor agents.  He eventually was stabilized on a regimen of
Dopamine, Norepinephrine, and vasopressin.  The
Norepinephrine and vasopressin were maintained at maximum
doses, while the Dopamine was at the range of [**5-7**]
mcg/kg/minute.  The patient's central venous pressure
appeared to be low and he was continued to be aggressively
hydrated with multiple IV fluid boluses.

There was no obvious source of infection found at the time of
this dictation, however, his white count did continue to
trend upward into the 20 range.  Blood cultures have been
sent again to seek a source of infection which may not be
covered by his current antibiotic regimen.  Also, at this
time we are considering repeating an ultrasound to look for
any evidence of obstruction so that if his alkaline
phosphatase continues to elevate despite the improvement in
his total bilirubin and his other liver function tests.  At
the time of this dictation, the patient is still too unstable
to have an MRCP performed nor would he potentially tolerate
therapeutic ERCP.

Extensive discussions have been held with the family to
discuss his overall condition and poor prognosis.  The
patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2048**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3640**], has also
been involved in these discussions.  At the time of this
dictation, the patient's family has decided that he will
remain a full code status.  However, they wish that if he
does have an arrest, that a prolonged code not be performed
should he not be revivable in a quick manner.

A discharge summary addendum will follow this discharge
summary to summarize the remaining events during this
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course.

[**11-29**] week history chest discomfort with shortness of breath,
nausea, and vomitting.  He reports sub-sternal chest pain that
awoke him from sleep on the morning of admission.  In the
emergency room he had some ST depressions on EKG with + enzymes.

In the cardiac cath lab he was found to have 3 VD with 80% LM,
80% LAD, 50% LCx, and 90% RCA.
He was at that time referred for coronary artery bypass
grafting.
On exam, this patient was found to have carotid bruits
bilaterally with carotid ultrasound showing  a 70-79% stenosis
on the left side.  A neurology consult was obtained stating,
after thorough exam, that the patient was thought to be safe for
surgery without further neurological examination.
He proceeded to the operating room on [**2161-12-3**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**].
 He underwent a CABG x 3 with LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the Diag,
and SVG to the PDA and PLB.  Total cardio-pulmonary bypass time
78 minutes and cross clamp time 49 minutes.  He proceeded to the
CSRU in a NSR with rate 74, MAP 85, CVP 16, on neo and propofol
drips.
He failed to weane in the immediate post-operative period but
was successfully weaned and extubated on the evening of post-op
day one.  He was initially confused with periods of lucidity.
On POD 3 he experienced atrial fibrillation and was started on
amiodarone.  Becasue of his history of COPD adn asthma,
lopressor was used cautiously and hydralazine was used for HTN.
On this same day, his mediastinal chest tubes were discontinued.
On POD 4 amiodarone was changed to PO, NPH insulin was started
for blood glucose control, and he was transferred to the
inpatient floor for continued rehabilitation and recovery.
On POD 5 his remaining chest tubes and epicardial wires were
discontinued.  He continued in atrial fibrillation with ongoing
amiodarone and low-dose beta blockers.
Mr. [**Known lastname 4401**] was known to [**Last Name (un) 39324**] chronic renal insufficiency with a
pre-op creat of 1.9.  On POD 6, his creat was elevated to 2.6.
He was also noted to be 10 kg up from his pre-op weight.  His
lasix was thus discontinued and natracor was initiated for
diuresis.  On this same day he converted to a NSR.
On post-operative day 8, he lost his venous access and was sent
for PICC placement for continued natracor therapy.
On POD 9 a renal consult was obtained.  They recommended
continued natracor with lasix for increased diuresis.
(Creatinine 2.6.)  Continued to diuresis with both lasix and
natracor for 4 days with discontinuation of natracor on POD 12.
(Creatinine 2.8.)
On POD 13, renal signed-off as they felt situation was stable.
He continued to diurese with lasix; with creatinine stable at
2.7-2.9, and weight decreasing.
He had a burst of strial fibrillation on POD 15 and converted to
NSR following an IV amiodarone bolus and ongoing PO amiodarone.

He was followed by the physical therapy team throughout his
hospitalization and was thought not to be safe for home.  He was
recommended for rehabilitation placement.
On the day of dichharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 4401**] was stable with his
creatinine dropping (2.2) and his edema and weight lessening.

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an unfortunate
80-year-old female with a prior medical history of
hypertension, osteoporosis, prior left carotid stenosis, and
had subsequent left carotid endarterectomy as well as history
of polymyalgia rheumatica, who was involved in a motor
vehicle accident as an unrestrained driver with possible loss
of consciousness.

She was initially seen at an outside facility on [**4-13**],
the date of her accident.  She was doing well,
hemodynamically stable, however, she was complaining of
left-sided chest pain.  She was diagnosed with multiple left
sided rib fractures and evidence of crepitus.  Her
saturations were okay.  However, she was quite tachypneic.
She additionally had dropped her systolic blood pressure into
the 90s at the outside facility from an admission blood
pressure in the 130s, and was found to have a hematocrit of
22.  She was given 2 units of packed cells, and transferred
here.

Presentation to the Trauma Bay showed her to have extensive
work of breathing requiring subsequent intubation.  Initial
trauma survey revealed crepitus in the left chest and
decreased breath sounds necessitating insertion of a left
chest tube.  Chest x-ray had confirmed that she had a large
left-sided effusion and multiple rib fractures with no
obvious pneumothorax.  Subsequent to this, the patient was
stabilized and received her protocol imaging.  Her CT of the
head was otherwise unremarkable.  Her CT of the chest
revealed a large left hemothorax with no evidence of
pneumothorax.  A large left pulmonary contusion.
Additionally, the scan of the chest revealed a right distal
clavicular fracture and left scapular fracture.  Her CT of
the neck was unremarkable.  Her CT of the head was negative.
CT of abdomen with intravenous contrast on initial survey
additionally showed no evidence of parenchymal or abdominal
visceral injury.  She was admitted to the Trauma Critical
Care Unit for further resuscitation.

Her admission examination was notable for a temperature of
95.3 rectally, heart rate of 107, sinus tachycardia.  Her
blood pressure is 104/39, the respiratory rate of 14, and
saturating 100% and vented.  She was intubated, however, she
was awake and following commands.  She had coarse breath
sounds bilaterally.  On the left, she was markedly
diminished.  She was tachycardic, but had no murmurs, rubs,
or gallops.  Her left chest had some mild crepitus, but there
was no evidence of instability or flail segment.  Her abdomen
was soft and nontender.  There was no ecchymosis or abrasion.
Her pelvis was stable.  The rectal examination had loose
tone, guaiac negative, no masses.  Her flanks and back were
otherwise normal without obvious deformity or injury.  Her
extremities showed no obvious deformity.  There was some
minor cuts and scrapes over the knees and right elbow.  She
was able to move all extremities.  Her right upper extremity
and left upper extremity were somewhat limited by pain,
however.

Over the ensuing hours of her admission, however, she became
hemodynamically unstable despite being aggressively
resuscitated.  The patient was profoundly acidotic and
dropped her hematocrit to 26.  Her abdomen became
progressively more distended and had hemodynamic instability
requiring high dose of dopamine and Levophed.  Upright chest
x-ray had been repeated showing no evidence of
intraabdominal free air.  She had a transthoracic
echocardiogram by the oncall Cardiology fellow that night of
injury revealing a hyperdynamic left ventricular function
with an EF greater than 75%, a normal RV systolic function,
no mitral regurgitation, no evidence of pericardial effusion.
There was spontaneous collapse of the inferior vena cava and
the mechanically ventilated patient, which suggested profound
hypovolemia, and her tachycardia precluded adequate
evaluation of any wall motion abnormalities.

Due to the fact that the patient had initial survey on
abdominal CT showing no evidence of visceral injury and the
rapidly progressing abdominal distention with acidosis and
somewhat collapsed IVC, it was thought that the patient may
in fact be suffering from an abdominal compartment syndrome.

She was thereafter sent to the operating room on the early
morning hours of [**2178-4-14**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] took her to
the OR, performed a trauma laparotomy.  There was no obvious
injury to the viscera.  However, after opening the abdomen,
the patient profoundly improved confirming the likely
diagnosis of abdominal compartment syndrome.  She only had
100 cc estimated blood loss during this procedure.  Received
1200 cc of intravenous fluids and urine output was 700 cc for
the case.

Patient left the operating room intubated, sedated.  Over the
ensuing days, the patient progressed into acute respiratory
distress syndrome as defined by her PAO2:FIO2 ratio being
less than 200 with bilateral infiltrates particularly worse
on the left side, where she had a confirmed contusion and
left hemothorax.  There was no obvious persistent
pneumothorax, however, as her daily chest x-ray evaluation
confirmed this with a left chest tube being repositioned.
She was given maximal lung protective ventilation strategy
including paralysis, low tidal ventilation, and permissive
hypercapnia and permission hypoxia.  Over the ensuing days
she improved.  Her tube feed regimen was serially increased.
She had a pulmonary artery catheter that had been placed
during her postoperative course for guidance of her fluid and
electrolyte therapy.

Ultimately, the patient actually somewhat rallied and
improved.  We were able to dial back her intravenous fluids,
titrate up her tube feedings to a goal.  Ultimately, her ARDS
seemed to improve and she was actually switched from an
assist control setting into a pressure support ventilatory
mode.  Her pain control was a [**Last Name **] problem.  We had
attempted an epidural twice, were unsuccessful at placement.
She did receive a left-sided rib block several times during
her ICU course to enhance her pain control and to give her an
opportunity to participate in her pulmonary rehab and vent
wean.

We utilized a variety of agents including NSAID therapy with
Vioxx as well as Roxicet elixir to control her
pain.  However, there was a significant component of pain and
overall deconditioning that made her ventilatory wean
prolonged.  She ultimately necessitated placement of an open
tracheostomy tube, which was performed on [**2178-4-27**] under
the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Therefore the patient had a speech and swallow evaluation,
and at the time of this discharge summary, the final report
of the speech and swallow evaluation was indeterminate.  The
plan was to place a discharge summary addendum with the
results of this were back if she were able to pass her speech
and swallow evaluation, she will be titrated on an oral
regimen and serially advanced accordingly with tube feeds
being cycled at night and dialed back as needed as she took
adequate p.o. intake.  However, if she failed her speech and
swallow evaluation, she will likely need a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube for feeding access and then a
repeat speech and swallow evaluation as an outpatient can be
performed in a couple of weeks when her aspiration risk was
reduced, and that her mental status has improved.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS BY SYSTEM:  Neurologically:  She had a
negative head CT and negative CT C spine.  No MR films were
done.  She wore the collar for more than two weeks.  This was
ultimately removed.  She was able to interact, although not
at a very robust fashion, but could certainly localize her
gaze to the examiner, able to move her upper extremities with
limited range of motion.  Able to make weak grasp with
bilateral upper extremities.  Able to wiggle toes and
intermittently move her legs.  Therefore, she was following
simple commands.  She appeared to have somewhat blunted
affect despite being on a ventilator, the assessment was
whether she may or may not have been suffering from a mild
degree of depression as well as some intermittent waxing and
[**Doctor Last Name 688**] consciousness confirming the likely low grade
delirium.  However, this was florid and did not necessitate
antipsychotic regimen or one-to-one sitter or any restraining
mechanism.

Pulmonary wise:  The patient was on pressure support
ventilation approximately anywhere from 18 to 20 mmHg being
utilized.  She will continue prolong ventilatory wean.  Chest
x-ray showed no evidence pneumothorax.  She had mild
cephalization and evidence of mild overload, and she had
bilateral effusions left greater than right, but nothing that
seemed to be tapable at this time.  She had multiple left
sided rib fractures, left scapular fracture, and right distal
clavicular fracture, and her analgesic regimen will be key to
control so that she can participate in her ventilatory wean
and have adequate strength and analgesia to pull an adequate
tidal volume to allow appropriate weaning as needed.  She
will receive standard trach care as needed.  She had a #6
Shiley trach tube placed at the time of surgery on
[**2178-4-27**].

Cardiovascular wise:  The patient was stable on a
beta-blocker 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.  This can be titrated as
needed to control her blood pressure and heart rate.  She did
not have any specific parameters, however, it would be nice
to keep her systolic pressures at least under 160 with a
heart rate in the 70-80 range.  Her transthoracic
echocardiogram results were stated on the night of admission.
Her baseline cardiac medications included a beta-blocker and
aspirin.  Aspirin can be added back as needed on an
outpatient basis in the vent rehab facility.

FEN and GI:  Patient had speech and swallow evaluation
pending at the time of this dismissal.  If she were to fail
this evaluation, she will get a PEG tube placed, and
continued on Impact with fiber full strength at 60 cc per
hour.  This can be cycled serially at night as needed.
Ultimately, she can be reassessed for possible swallowing
function in the rehab setting so that she can ultimately
hopefully be weaned off a tube feeding regimen.  She was not
receiving any additional motility agents such as Reglan at
the time of this dismissal note.  Her electrolytes were
otherwise stable.

Heme/ID:  She had no infectious issues.  She had some yeast
that had grown out from a sputum sample at the end of [**Month (only) 958**],
however, she did not have any florid infiltrate on chest
x-ray.  Her sputum was somewhat tan colored in nature, but
ultimately it was not felt that she was suffering from a
ventilator-associated pneumonia.  At this time, she was not
on any antibiotics.  She had a hematocrit of 28.6 and a white
count was 7.8 on [**2178-4-29**] with a normal platelet count of
407.

For Endocrine:  She should be on a sliding scale regimen.
She should be placed on a NPH regimen and tighten her sliding
scales for normoglycemia with goal blood sugars of 120-140
can be achieved.  This should be continued indefinitely.  The
patient almost certainly has some component of insulin
resistance or perhaps undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.

GU/renal:  She had a Foley catheter for urine output
monitoring.  She had no significant urinary cultures.  Her
creatinine was 0.5 on [**2178-4-29**] with a BUN of 23.  She was
making approximately 1-1.5 liters of urine per day.

Tubes, lines, and drains:  At the time of this dismissal,
discharge summary, she did have a left subclavian, which was
a triple lumen catheter, which had been in place for 15 days
as well as a left radial A line.  Ultimately on dismissal,
she likely will not have her radial arterial line unless
deemed appropriate by the ventilatory rehab facility.
Additionally, she was receiving feedings through a
nasogastric tube pending the speech and swallow evaluation.
She may not end up with a PEG tube, thereby removing that
nasogastric tube accordingly.

Prophylaxis:  She should continue on Prevacid 30 mg/NG q.d.
or per PEG as needed if she ends up with a PEG.  She can be
on Lovenox 30 mg subq b.i.d. for DVT prophylaxis, Lopressor
25 mg p.o. b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Roxicet elixir as
needed, Vioxx 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Dulcolax suppository 10 mg p.o./p.r. one tablet q.d. prn.

Her followup plans will be to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1022**] in
approximately one month from time of dismissal.  Call this
clinic for this follow-up appointment.  Additionally, she
should follow up in the Trauma Clinic in approximately 3-4
weeks from time of dismissal if she has been appropriately
weaned from the ventilator.  If she is still vent dependent,
then she will stay at the [**Hospital 5442**] Rehab until which time, she
has been weaned from the ventilator and then she may follow
up on a prn basis to the Trauma Clinic.

TREATMENTS AND FREQUENCIES:  She will continue on aggressive
enteral feeding regimen her speech and swallow evaluation
will proceed.  If her swallowing is poor, then she will
receive a PEG tube for enteral access and feeding, and this
can be reassessed as an outpatient in the ventilatory rehab
setting to see if she can ultimately be started on an oral
regimen.  She was not requiring any motility agents at this
time to assist her with her tube feeding tolerance.  She
should be on aggressive bowel regimen.  Her blood pressure
control is as stated above.  She will need aggressive
Physical Therapy.  She can be full weightbearing on her lower
extremities as tolerated despite the pelvic fracture as
previously noted.  Additionally, she should continue
aggressive Physical Therapy, be out of bed, get a chest
physiotherapy and incentive spirometry, and trach care as
standard fashion.

Brief Hospital Course:
86F with history of severe dementia, presents with fever and
altered mental status, code sepsis in ED.  The patient was
resuscitated and admitted to the MICU.  She was diagnosed with
pneumonia and treated with Zosyn and Vancomycin for broad
coverage.  After she was stabilized and weaned off of pressors,
she was transferred to the regular medical floor where she
remained stable.  She was discharged back to her NH in stable
condition.
.
# AMS/infection: The patient is severely demented at baseline.
A head CT completed in the ED was negative, and she did not have
any focal neurological deficits on exam (although it was limited
by the language barrier).  On admission to the ICU, she had a
clean UA but a RUL consolidation consistent with aspiration
pneumonia.  She was also hypernatremic which would also account
for AMS.  She was repleted with free water to correct her
sodium, and she was continued on both Vanc and Zosyn for
antibiotics.  Given that she was recently hospitalized for
influenza earlier in the month, it was thought she was at high
risk for a nosocomial pneumonia, (also staph a. pneumonia post
influenza).  She had a repeat CXR the following day, which
showed a more definitive infiltrate to suggest pneumonia.  [**2-7**]
bottles from her blood cultures grew coag negative staph.  On
the morning following admission, she became much more alert and
talkative, demonstrating echolalia.  Her family confirmed that
her mental status was close to baseline on discharge.  A PICC
line was placed by IR on [**4-8**] without complication.  She was
discharged on 10 days of vancomycin and zosyn therapy.  Her home
medications for Alzheimer's were intially held while she was NPO
but were restarted on transfer to the floor.
.
# F/E/N: She was initially kept NPO out of concern for sepsis
and altered mental status.  She had recently undergone a speech
and swallow eval at [**Hospital1 2025**]; these results were obtained, which
recommended the patient be kept on a pureed diet with honey
thickened liquids.  She was fed under aspiration precautions.
