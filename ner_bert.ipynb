As we \\ndiscussed, everyone has a different dose of lasix required to \\nmake them urinate and it's likely that you weren't taking a high \\nenough dose. Please take these medications daily to keep excess \\nfluid off and eat a low salt diet. You will follow up with Dr. \\n___ in liver clinic and from there have your colonoscopy \\nand EGD scheduled. Of course, we are always here if you need us. \\nWe wish you all the best!\\nYour ___ Team.  \\n \\nFollowup Instructions:\\n___\\n\",\n",
